5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the enterprising and energetic
editor of <i>The Fireside</i> wrote suggesting that he should
print my articles on the London Directory, published at various
intervals during the last two years in that magazine, I was
somewhat taken aback.&nbsp; I will candidly confess that half of
them, or thereabouts, were written with some degree of care: I
will as honestly admit that the rest were indited amid the press
of heavy ministerial labours, and had to take their chance, as
regards manner, method, and matter.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I may add
that, however wanting in order and sequence several chapters
appeared on paper, I was not afraid for the accuracy of their
contents.&nbsp; My only credit for this, supposing my lack of
fear to be well founded, is that which attaches to diligent
research.&nbsp; The only true means of discovering the origin of
our surnames is to find the earliest form of entry.&nbsp; Light
upon that, and half the difficulty vanishes.&nbsp; This is a
means which is as open to any of my readers as myself&mdash;more
so in the case of those who dwell in the metropolis.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity of apologising to many readers of
<i>The </i><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span><i>Fireside</i>, who have written to me asking for
information in respect of their own, or some other name they were
interested in.&nbsp; A few I have been able to answer; the rest
have had to lie by, for I have not had the time or health to
attend to them.&nbsp; I only wish there was the possibility of
this preface meeting the eye of my American cousins.&nbsp; I have
a large batch of letters of inquiry, from the other side of the
Atlantic, to scarcely one of which have I been able to make
reply.&nbsp; I feel truly sorry, for I would not seem to be
wanting in courtesy to one of them.&nbsp; These more distant
inquiries have resulted rather from the publication of
&ldquo;English Surnames&rdquo; (issued by Messrs. Chatto and
Windus, Piccadilly), than the articles in <i>The
Fireside</i>.&nbsp; And I would take this opportunity of
recommending such of my readers as have become interested in the
science of nomenclature, through a perusal of these elementary
papers, to study that work.&nbsp; I can do this the more readily
as I have no pecuniary interest in the sale thereof!</p>
<p>Not the least of the pleasures attending the writing of these
papers has been the opportunity it gave me of making personal
acquaintance with the Editor.&nbsp; I trust God will bless him in
his most useful enterprise.</p>

I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">INDIVIDUALIZATION AND
LOCALIZATION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> proverbs are not necessarily
true, but that which asserts that &ldquo;every man has his
hobby&rdquo; few will gainsay.&nbsp; Nothing in a house so well
betrays this hobby as the owner&rsquo;s bookcase.&nbsp; It may be
large, or it may be small, but there the secret lies.&nbsp; One
man&rsquo;s hobby is angling, and his shelf begins with quaint
Isaac Walton, and ends with the <i>Field</i> newspaper of last
week.&nbsp; Another has a liking for natural science, and his
library is a <i>vade mecum</i> of its mysteries.&nbsp; A
third&mdash;oftentimes a lady&mdash;loves ferns, and her study is
a little compendium of that curious literature that has all but
wholly sprung up within the present generation.&nbsp; Even the
young lady&rsquo;s shelf of poems, or novels, or histories,
betrays, if not the bent of her mind, the bias of her
education.</p>
<p>My hobby is Nomenclature, and my library betrays my weakness
in&mdash;what class of books, do you
think?&mdash;directories!&nbsp; You would think I was a postal <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>official.&nbsp; I have London Directories, Provincial
Town Directories, and County Directories.&nbsp; I have even a
Paris and a New York Directory.&nbsp; But herein lies a strange
truth.&nbsp; I find as much pleasure in perusing these
directories as any schoolgirl over her first and most sensational
novel.&nbsp; The grand finale of murders, suicides from
third-storey windows, and runaway weddings, all so thrillingly
blended, cannot be half so absorbing to her&mdash;not that I
recommend her to read such things&mdash;as the last chapter of
the London Post Office Directory, from Y to Z, is to me.&nbsp; It
is the conclusion of one of the grandest and most highly wrought
romances ever put together by the ingenuity of man.&nbsp;
Oftentimes in the evening I take it down from my shelf, and I
never feel tempted to skip the pages.&nbsp; Nay, when I have at
last got to Z, I can begin at A again with but freshened
interest; for the Directory will bear reading twice.</p>
<p>The London Directory, to every one who has the key that
unlocks its treasures, is at once an epitome of all antiquarian
knowledge.&nbsp; In it I can trace the lives of my countrymen
backwards for many a century.&nbsp; In it is furnished a full and
detailed account of the habits and the customs of my
ancestry&mdash;the dress they wore, the food they ate, six
hundred years ago; though that it is not so far back as the
Welshman&rsquo;s pedigree, which hung from his sitting-room
ceiling to the floor, and half-way up had a note to the effect
that &ldquo;about this time Adam was born.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, I can
but pretend to go up some eighteen or twenty steps of the ladder
of my family nomenclature.&nbsp; Nevertheless, by one glance at
your name <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>I can tell you&mdash;unless its spelling be hopelessly
corrupted&mdash;whether the progenitor of your race was Scotch,
Irish, English, Norman, French, German, or even Oriental.&nbsp; I
can tell you what was his peculiar weakness, or his particular
vocation in life.&nbsp; I can declare the complexion of his hair;
whether he was long or short, straight or crooked, weak or
strong.&nbsp; I can whisper to you what his neighbours thought of
him; whether they deemed him generous or miserly, churlish or
courteous.&nbsp; Yes, sometimes I must tell you unpleasant truths
about your great, great, great (<i>ad infinitum</i>)
grandfather.&nbsp; For the Directory is remarkably truthful; it
won&rsquo;t spare anybody, high or low, rich or poor.&nbsp; I
have heard people telling of the greatness of their ancestral
name, and the said name on their visiting card was laughing at
them all the time &ldquo;behind its back.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have
seen men dwelling in back slums contented with their sphere, and
yet ignorant of the fact that they bore a sobriquet which six
centuries ago would have brought them respect from the king on
his throne down to the humblest cottager in the land.&nbsp; Oh,
the ups and downs of life, as related in this big romance, put to
paper by prosaic clerks, who never smiled at the fun, nor dropped
a tear at the distress, simply because they lacked the manual
that should explain its merriment and interpret its pathos!&nbsp;
Hieroglyphics, believe me, are not confined to Egyptian obelisks
or Oriental slabs.</p>
<p>But some reader, perchance, will say, &ldquo;What do you
mean?&nbsp; Is there anything more in a surname than the
individuality it gives to the present bearer?&nbsp; In itself is
it not purely accidental?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course it is <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>accidental.&nbsp; A fossil shell is accidental; but
place it in the hand of a geologist, and he will talk for five
days upon it, barring the time he will want for eating and
sleeping.&nbsp; And a surname is a fossil&mdash;not millions of
years old, may be, like the shell; only six hundred&mdash;still a
fossil, and therefore stereotyping the state and condition of
human life at the period when it came into being.&nbsp; A surname
not only gives individuality to the present bearer, but is a
distinct statement of some condition or capacity enjoyed or
endured by the first possessor.&nbsp; An instance will prove
this.&nbsp; Take the name of &ldquo;Cruikshank.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There must have been some particular ancestor so designated
because he had a &ldquo;crooked leg.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is a fact
to start with.&nbsp; Do you want to know where he lived, and
when?&nbsp; Well, there is no great difficulty in the
matter.&nbsp; The very spelling &ldquo;cruik,&rdquo; and not
&ldquo;crook,&rdquo; proves that he was a north countryman.&nbsp;
Is that all?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;shank&rdquo; shows
that he received this nickname before &ldquo;leg&rdquo; had come
into ordinary use.&nbsp; <i>Leg</i> is always used for
<i>shank</i> now, yet it is first found in England about the year
1250.&nbsp; It is comparatively modern.&nbsp; Hence there is no
surname that I know of with &ldquo;leg&rdquo; as an ingredient.
<a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; In later days he would have been
called &ldquo;Bow-leg.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once more, nickname-surnames
are scarcely ever found to be <i>hereditary</i> before the year
1200.&nbsp; Here then I glean four facts about
&ldquo;Cruikshank&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; The first Mr. Cruikshank was bow-legged.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>(2)&nbsp; He came from the borders of Scotland, or still
more north.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; He lived previous to the year 1400.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp; And not earlier than the year 1200.</p>
<p>I have taken this instance hap-hazard.&nbsp; I might have
selected an exacter illustration, but this will answer my
purpose.&nbsp; It is possible my reader will now say, &ldquo;But
there must be a good substructure of primary knowledge laid
before I can take up the London Directory, and pretend to be
immensely interested in it, and tell my friends what capital
reading it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, every true pleasure must
be bought, and study will purchase infinitely higher delights
than money can ever do.&nbsp; It is partly that you may learn how
to acquire that necessary elementary knowledge that I am about to
write these short chapters upon the London Directory.</p>
<p>Before I begin, let me say a few words about
<i>personality</i> and <i>locality</i>.&nbsp; We should always
begin at the beginning.&nbsp; The preacher never starts at
fourthly; soup by some mysterious law ever precedes fish.&nbsp;
Remember, the necessity for individuality has given us our
Names.&nbsp; The need of an address has originated our
Directories.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; <i>Individualization</i>.&nbsp; The word
<i>sur</i>name means an <i>added</i> name&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a
sobriquet added to the personal or baptismal name.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because one was not sufficient to give individuality
to the bearer.&nbsp; Adam and Eve, and Seth, and Abel, and
Joseph, and Moses, all were enough while population was small;
but manifestly such simplicity could not last.&nbsp; In the
wilderness there were, say, 2,500,000 Israelites.&nbsp; How <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>could one
suffice there, especially if &ldquo;Caleb&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Joshua&rdquo; had become so popular that there were, say,
50 or 100 of each in the closely-packed community?&nbsp; It was
not enough: therefore we find a surname adopted, that is, an
added name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joshua, the son of
Nun&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Caleb, the son of
Jephunneh&rdquo;&mdash;are amongst the world&rsquo;s first
surnames.&nbsp; In Directory language this is simply
&ldquo;Joshua Nunson,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Caleb
Jephunneh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Simon Barjonas is nothing more than Simon
Johnson.&nbsp; Remember, however, these were not
<i>hereditary</i>.&nbsp; They died with their owner, and the
child, if there was one, got a surname of his own.&nbsp; Surnames
did not become hereditary in Europe even till the beginning of
the twelfth century, and among the lower classes not till the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Imagine London with, say, 3,000,000 souls, each possessing but
one name.&nbsp; Picture to yourself to-morrow&rsquo;s post
bringing 1000 letters to &ldquo;Mr. John,&rdquo; or &ldquo;John,
Esquire.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t conceive it.&nbsp; No, a
surname became an imperative necessity when population increased,
when men herded together, and communities began to be
formed.&nbsp; It is curious to note that some of these surnames
have become so common that they have failed of their object, and
ceased to give individuality.&nbsp; There are 270,000
&ldquo;Smiths&rdquo; in England and Wales, and as many
&ldquo;Joneses.&rdquo;&nbsp; They would together form a town as
large as Manchester, or separately as big as Leeds.&nbsp; William
Smith scarcely individualizes the bearer now; so he either gets
three names or four names at the font, or his identity is eked
out by a remarkable single name, perchance
&ldquo;Plantagenet,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kerenhappuck,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Napoleon,&rdquo; or <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>&ldquo;Sidney.&rdquo;&nbsp; The worst
of it is that &ldquo;Sidney&rdquo; was so greedily fixed upon
after it became famous that there are now hundreds of
&ldquo;Sidney Smiths,&rdquo; and thus it has ceased to give
proper individuality.&nbsp; It is the same with &ldquo;John
Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Registrar-General says that if
&ldquo;John Jones&rdquo; were called out at a market in Wales,
either everybody would come, or nobody: either everybody,
thinking that you meant each, or nobody, because you had not
added some description which should distinguish the particular
John Jones you wanted.&nbsp; I remember at college two John
Joneses went in for examination for the &ldquo;little
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both belonged to the same college; one passed,
the other did not.&nbsp; The one who got first to the schools
bore away his certificate in triumph.&nbsp; The one who came last
always declared that his <i>confr&egrave;re</i> had robbed him of
his &ldquo;testamur,&rdquo; and I have no doubt will die assured
of the same!&nbsp; I believe a day will come when, either by
compulsory enactment or by voluntary arrangement, there will be a
redistribution of surnames in Wales; the sooner the better.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; <i>Localization</i>.&nbsp; So much for the
personality; now for locality.&nbsp; It is one thing to know the
name of the man you want; it is another thing to know where you
can find him.&nbsp; In a word, where does he live?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire
in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus,&rdquo; says
the Divine Book.&nbsp; This would not be enough in the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; There are streets a mile long now.&nbsp; There are
restaurants above the shops, and offices above the restaurants,
and the old woman who cleans the building <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>above them
all.&nbsp; How is Mrs. Betsy Pipps to be found of her
friends?&nbsp; Yet a letter from her daughter in the country
about the cows and the turnips has as much right to find its way
to that top room in the murky city as a posted document about
Turkey and Russia to Lord Derby in that big place a little
further on.</p>
<p>One of the greatest transformations the streets of London ever
saw was when the signboards were taken down.&nbsp; These were at
first adopted purely to localize the inhabitant of the house
pendent from whose wall the signboard swung.&nbsp; Until the
reign of Queen Anne, the streets could scarcely be seen further
than a few yards because of these innumerable obstructions.&nbsp;
They darkened the streets, obscured the view, and threatened the
very lives of the horsemen who rode along.&nbsp; The personal
discomfort to wayfarers was great, for not only did the rain drip
unpleasantly from them, but the wooden spouts, which frequently
shot forward from the roof in order that the signboard might
swing from them, poured their little cataracts upon the devoted
heads of the passers-by.&nbsp; This infliction was patiently
endured for several centuries; but the British ratepayer at last
made his voice heard, as in the end he always does.&nbsp; This
time, too, he had right on his side, as he invariably thinks he
has, and an alteration took place.&nbsp; The ruling powers
ordered the obnoxious signs to be placed flat against the
walls.&nbsp; The idea of removing them entirely was reserved for
a more brilliant intellect a few years later on.&nbsp; I have not
yet seen the printed regulation for the metropolis, but no doubt
the Manchester document was but a <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>copy of it.&nbsp; The declaration
issued for that town runs as follows: &ldquo;With the approbation
and concurrence of the magistrates, we, the borough reeve and
constables, request the shopkeepers and innholders of this town,
who have not already taken down their signs, to do the same as
soon as possible, and place them against the walls of their
houses, as they have been long and justly complained of as
nuisances.&nbsp; They obstruct the free passage of the air, annoy
the passengers in wet weather, darken the streets,
etc.,&mdash;all which inconvenience will be prevented by a
compliance with our request, and be manifestly productive both of
elegance and utility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the utility there could be no doubt.&nbsp; In wet weather,
as already hinted, everybody who had a coat collar had to turn it
up to prevent each swinging sign from dripping the rain-water
down the back of the neck.&nbsp; Umbrellas were still rare,
costly, and curious luxuries.&nbsp; In a word, the swinging sign
was voted an intolerable nuisance, was found guilty, and
condemned&mdash;not to the gallows, of course, for the charge
against it was that it had been hanging there to the public
detriment all its days&mdash;but to oblivion.&nbsp; I daresay
London had made away with many of its cumbersome signboards many
years before the provincial towns.&nbsp; It is curious to note
that in a hundred different nooks and corners of old London there
still linger some of the tradesmen&rsquo;s signs, either
flattened against the wall, or carved upon the now crumbling
stonework.</p>
<p>There are endless allusions to the signs of old London in the
comic or semi-comic rhymes of the <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>period.&nbsp; Thomas Heywood, early
in the seventeenth century, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gintry to the <i>King&rsquo;s
Head</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nobles to the <i>Crown</i>,<br />
The knights unto the <i>Golden Fleece</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the <i>Plough</i> the clowne.<br />
The Churchman to the <i>Mitre</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shepherd to the <i>Star</i>,<br />
The gardener hies him to the <i>Rose</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the <i>Drum</i> the man of war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a capital collection of these names in a ballad of
the Restoration, which is far too long to quote in full, but of
which the following is a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Through the Royal Exchange as I walked,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where gallants in sattin doe shine,<br />
At midst of the day they parted away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seaverall places to dine.<br />
The ladyes will dine at the <i>Feathers</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Globe</i> no captaine will scorne,<br />
The huntsman will goe to the <i>Greyhound</i> below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some will hie to the <i>Horne</i>.<br />
The farriers will to the <i>Horse</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blacksmith unto the <i>Locke</i>,<br />
The butchers unto the <i>Bull</i> will goe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the carmen to Bridewell <i>Clocke</i>.<br />
The pewterers to the <i>Quarte Pot</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The coopers will dine at the <i>Hoope</i>,<br />
The coblers to the <i>Last</i> will goe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bargemen to the <i>Sloope</i>.<br />
The goldsmith will to the <i>Three Cups</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For money they hold it as drosse;<br />
Your Puritan to the <i>Pewter-canne</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And your Papists to the <i>Crosse</i>.<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Thus every
man in his humour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That comes from the northe or the southe;<br />
But he that has no money in his purse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May dine at the signe of the
<i>Mouth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Pasquin, in his &ldquo;Night-cap,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First there is Maister Peter at the
<i>Bell</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A linen draper, and a wealthy man;<br />
Then Maister Thomas that doth stockings sell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And George the grocer at the <i>Frying Pan</i>.<br
/>
And Maister Miles the mercer at the <i>Harrow</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Maister Mike the silkman at the <i>Plow</i>,<br
/>
And Maister Nicke the Salter at the <i>Sparrow</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Maister Dicke the vintner at the
<i>Cow</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another jingling rhyme began:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m amused at the signs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I pass through the town,<br />
To see the odd mixture,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A &lsquo;Magpie and Crown,&rsquo;<br />
The &lsquo;Whale and the Crow,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Razor and Hen,&rsquo;<br />
The &lsquo;Leg and Seven Stars,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Scissors and Pen,&rsquo;<br />
The &lsquo;Axe and the Bottle,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Tun and the Lute,&rsquo;<br />
The &lsquo;Eagle and Child,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Shovel and Boot.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These double signs were very common, and are easily
explained.&nbsp; Now-a-days a man who has taken the goodwill of a
well-established shop paints over the door &ldquo;Snooks, late
Jopson, Chemist.&rdquo;&nbsp; The apprentice in old days added
his own badge to that of his late master, and the signboard
displayed perhaps the <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>&ldquo;Mermaid and Gridiron,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Leg and Crow,&rdquo; the old sign being linked to
the new.</p>
<p>The reader may think I have dwelt somewhat long upon this
matter; but I am writing about localization, and these signboards
in their day were the only means of identifying the London
tradesman.&nbsp; Names and numbers were practically
useless.&nbsp; How small a proportion of the London population
could read even two hundred years ago!&nbsp; Mr. Baxter might
have &ldquo;Baxter&rdquo; in the largest gilt characters over his
front; he might further add that he made and sold that
newly-discovered luxury tobacco on the counter within,&mdash;but
how many of the passers-by would be any the wiser!&nbsp; But if
he had a large swinging board at the end of a pole, facing the
wayfarers, with a huge Turk&rsquo;s head with a pipe in its
mouth, there was none but could tell his occupation.&nbsp;
Sometimes the real article was exhibited.&nbsp; The hosier would
dangle a pair of stockings from his pole.&nbsp; Thus it was that
every shopkeeper was known by his sign.&nbsp; The housewife would
send little Tom to the &ldquo;Cock,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Three
Cranes,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Ark,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Hand-in-hand&rdquo; for her little domestic wants, where
now she would bid him run to &ldquo;Tomkins&rsquo;,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Sawyer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Robinson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; In course of time the sign
did not always harmonize with the articles sold within, but it
was quite enough for the neighbours dwelling around.&nbsp; What
an array of creaking posts and grotesque frames must there not
have been along the leading thoroughfares, such as Cheapside, and
old London Bridge! and leaving out the question of discomfort,
and the perils of a broken head if you drove <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>on a coach,
what a picturesque scene it must have been!</p>
<p>I dare not say what a large proportion of names in the London
Directory that look like nicknames must be set down as the result
of this old-fashioned custom.&nbsp; The fourteenth century saw
London streets looking as if hung with bannerets, so crowded were
they with signs.&nbsp; That was a period when half of the lower
middle class were still without an hereditary surname.&nbsp; The
consequence is, we find such entries as &ldquo;Hugh atte
Cokke,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thomas atte Ram,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thomas
del Hat,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Margery de Styrop.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
reader must see at a glance that we have here the origination of
half our &ldquo;Cocks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coxes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rams,&rdquo; &ldquo;Roebucks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tubbs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bells,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crows.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are three
&ldquo;Hatts&rdquo; to forty-one &ldquo;Heads,&rdquo; three
&ldquo;Pates&rdquo; and two &ldquo;Crowns&rdquo; in the London
Directory, not to mention three &ldquo;Harrows,&rdquo; two
&ldquo;Plows,&rdquo; four &ldquo;Boots,&rdquo; and ten
&ldquo;Pattens.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these, and a hundred other names
that appear difficult of origination, are easily explained when
we recall this faded custom of a few centuries ago.</p>
<p>The plan of having numbered doors came into use but very
recently.&nbsp; The signboards were disused in many parts of
London before numerals were instituted.&nbsp; The addresses on
letters appeared very strange as a consequence.</p>
<p>John Byrom, the great epigrammatist, writing to his wife from
Cambridge in 1727, addresses his letter to &ldquo;Mistress Eliz.
Byrom, near the old Church, in Manchester.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was
the ordinary method, to choose some big well-known building, and
state your <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>friends&rsquo; position to it by the compass.&nbsp; The
first Directory ever published, of any pretensions, was
Kent&rsquo;s, in 1736.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Directory,&rdquo; it is
called, &ldquo;sold by Henry Kent, in Finch Lane, near the Royal
Exchange.&rdquo;&nbsp; It contains about 1200 names, all the
tradesmen and merchants of London.&nbsp; There are such entries
as &ldquo;Samuel Wilson, hardwareman, in Cannon Street, the
corner of Crooked Lane,&rdquo; or &ldquo;John Bradshaw, opposite
the Monument, at a barber&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manifestly this could not go on.&nbsp; In the edition for 1770
occurs the following: &ldquo;The Directory . . . with the numbers
as they are affixed to their houses, agreeable to the late Acts
of Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Legislature had had to take the
matter into hand.&nbsp; London was getting far too big for
indistinct addresses such as these.&nbsp; The first street in the
metropolis to possess numbered doors was New Burlington
Street.&nbsp; This was accomplished in June 1764.&nbsp; Other
important throughfares followed suit, and before ten years had
gone by, we find the Directory particularizing as follows:
&ldquo;John Trelawney, haberdasher, No. 22, Nightingale
Lane,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hamnett Townley, hop merchant, No. 69,
Great Tower Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; Occasionally a &ldquo;Vincent
Trehearn, hatmaker, behind St. Thomas&rsquo;s,&rdquo; comes, but
rarely; and by-and-by such entries disappear altogether.&nbsp;
Manchester began the same practice in 1772, at the request of the
borough reeve and constable, and was the second town in the
kingdom to adopt the practice.</p>
<p>It was reserved for the year 1877 to put a climax, I think, to
ingenuity of this kind.&nbsp; In Manchester, <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>probably in
London also, there are lamp-post Directories.&nbsp; You cannot
always have a Directory at your elbow.&nbsp; Even this difficulty
is remedied by the lamp-post Directory.&nbsp; The names of all
shopkeepers in that particular street wherein the lamp-post
stands are printed alphabetically on a circular tablet, which
revolves round the post.&nbsp; You turn it round till you find
the name you want.</p>
<p>What ingenious creatures we are!&nbsp; Well might our great
poet say, &ldquo;What a piece of work is man! how noble in
reason, how infinite in faculties!&rdquo;&nbsp; Well might one
greater than William Shakespear declare, &ldquo;Thou hast made
him a little lower than the angels&rdquo;!&nbsp; The ingenuity of
man has created the surprises of history.</p>

24</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DIVISIONS OF LONDON
SURNAMES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have explained the origin of
surnames as an institution.&nbsp; We have shown that as the
population of the earth increased, and mankind began to form
themselves into closely-packed communities, a demand arose for a
more distinct individuality.&nbsp; As a consequence, men took an
additional sobriquet; or rather, it was fixed on them by their
neighbours, for in nine cases out of ten the bearer had no voice
in the matter.</p>
<p>The peculiar feature of our earlier surnames is that they were
<i>not hereditary</i>&mdash;father, mother, daughters, sons, and
even the grandchildren, might all be living at the same time, in
the same hamlet, even under the same roof, and yet possess each a
distinct sobriquet, which was the mark of their identity.&nbsp;
Let us first draw out an imaginary pedigree, and then quote from
a real one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>
<a href="images/p25b.jpg">

</a> <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>This would have to be the kind of family tree drawn out among
our country yeomen and town merchants, from say 1200 to 1450,
after which date we may begin to look for hereditary
surnames.&nbsp; The great-grandfather, Richard, is known by the
village in which his house is situate.&nbsp; Of three sons the
eldest, Richard, is distinguished from Richard his father by his
small stature.&nbsp; He becomes therefore Richard Little in the
common parlance of his neighbours.&nbsp; The second son, William,
has taken charge of the village pound for strayed cattle.&nbsp;
He is known as William atte Pound (<i>i.e.</i> at the
Pound).&nbsp; The third son, Henry, has very light hair, almost
white, although he is still but a youth.&nbsp; This being
somewhat remarkable, causes him to be distinguished from all
other Henrys in the same community by the sobriquet of Henry
Whitehead.&nbsp; Of the third generation, William atte Pound has
two sons, one of whom, Bartholomew, becomes a servitor of more
menial rank in the great baron&rsquo;s castle hard by.&nbsp; Of
course he becomes Bartholomew Page.&nbsp; The other John stays at
home to help his father.&nbsp; Naturally he is better recognised
by his filial relationship than his brother, and becomes John
William&rsquo;s son, and by-and-by John Williamson.&nbsp; But
Henry Whitehead has a son also, and as Hawkin or Halkin was then
the pet form of Henry, Adam, the son, becomes Adam Hawkins.&nbsp;
The fourth <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>generation will now be beyond the need of
explanation.</p>
<p>Take now a real pedigree from Camden:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p26b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Pedigree of William Belward of Malpas"
title=

 src="images/p26s.jpg" />
</a> <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>There is nothing that needs explanation in this pedigree
except Philip&rsquo;s surname of Gough.&nbsp; The family
residence was at Malpas, as seen above.&nbsp; This was on the
Welsh frontier.&nbsp; Gough is the Welsh for &ldquo;red,&rdquo;
so that Philip had evidently got his surname or nickname amongst
the Cambrian population from his ruddy complexion.</p>
<p>We are now well on the way to survey the groups or classes
into which the surnames in the London Directory can be
divided.&nbsp; Nothing can simplify the study of nomenclature so
readily as a consideration of the classes into which surnames may
be placed.&nbsp; If the reader will turn to the imaginary
pedigree of the Colton family, he will see that the ten surnames
therein contained may be set under five heads.&nbsp; Richard of
Colton, William atte Pound, and James Bentham, are known by a
<i>place-name</i>; John Williamson, Adam Hawkins and Alice Adams
by the <i>father&rsquo;s Christian name</i>; Richard the Baker by
his daily <i>occupation</i>; Bartholomew the Page by his
<i>official capacity</i>; and Richard the Little and Henry
Whitehead by a sobriquet having reference to their <i>personal
appearance</i>.&nbsp; Here, then, are five distinct
classes.&nbsp; <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>There is not a surname in the London Directory, nor in
England, nor in Europe, nor in the whole known or unknown world,
that cannot be placed, and placed correctly, under one of the
five heads that I have thus foreshadowed:&mdash;(1) Local
names.&nbsp; (2) Baptismal names.&nbsp; (3) Names of
occupation.&nbsp; (4) Official names.&nbsp; (5) Nicknames.&nbsp;
The first of these to become <i>hereditary</i> were the Norman
local names.&nbsp; Many of the Conqueror&rsquo;s followers took
or received as a surname the title of the place they left in
Normandy.&nbsp; He who left the chapelry of St. Clair across
&ldquo;the silver streak&rdquo; settled in England as
&ldquo;William, or Robert de St. Clair.&rdquo;&nbsp; In course of
time this became &ldquo;Sinclair&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Sinkler;&rdquo; just as &ldquo;St. Denis&rdquo; became
&ldquo;Sidney;&rdquo; &ldquo;St. Pierre,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Spier&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spiers;&rdquo; or &ldquo;St.
Leger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Selinger.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sinkler&rdquo;
is as vile a corruption of &ldquo;Sinclair&rdquo; as
&ldquo;Boil&rdquo; from &ldquo;Boyle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some folk say,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo;&nbsp; One thing is clear:
there is a good deal in the spelling of it.&nbsp; These local
names, however, were the first hereditary names in England.&nbsp;
But the Normans introduced representatives of all five
classes.&nbsp; Take a single instance of each.</p>

<p>Every secluded village in England at this moment, every
churchyard with its simple epitaphs, every vestry register with
its recorded births and marriages and deaths, contains
representatives of these several divisions.&nbsp; When we come to
such a big place as the metropolis, a little world of itself, we
expect to find these classes largely exhibited.&nbsp; I have
taken the trouble to analyse the first five letters of the
alphabet in the London Directory.&nbsp; Curious are the
results.&nbsp; We may premise that there are about 120,000 names
in the <i>Commercial</i> list.&nbsp; My analysis concerns about
30,000 of these&mdash;that is, exactly one-fourth.</p>

<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Without
some further explanation, these figures will seem utterly
incongruous.&nbsp; I make no apology for the somewhat large
number of doubtful instances.&nbsp; Those who have studied this
subject will consider it small.</p>
<p>Notice under &ldquo;A,&rdquo; the <i>baptismal</i> names are
double all other classes added together; while under
&ldquo;B,&rdquo; the <i>local</i> names, excluding doubtful
instances (a large proportion of which must be local), are also
double the rest.&nbsp; This is easily explained.&nbsp; Five
hundred years ago some Christian names were enormously
popular.&nbsp; Andrew was one.&nbsp; Under the forms of Andrews
and Anderson, etc., we have a total of 290 names.&nbsp; Allen was
another.&nbsp; There are 250 &ldquo;Allens&rdquo; <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a> in London, without adding other forms
of the name.&nbsp; There is no <i>local</i> name under
&ldquo;A&rdquo; to compare with these.&nbsp; Under
&ldquo;B&rdquo; this position is reversed.&nbsp; Of <i>local</i>
names there are about 142 Barnes, 56 Bartons, 37 Becks, 85
Berrys, 55 Boltons, 44 Booths, 58 Bradleys, 120 Brooks, besides a
large list of lesser but fairly proportionate names.&nbsp;
<i>Baptismal</i> names under &ldquo;B&rdquo; are not so
fortunate.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true there are 70 Barnards, 66 Balls
(Baldwin), 83 Bartletts (Bartholomew), 52 Bates (Bartholomew),
199 Bennetts (Benedict and Benjamin), and 40 Batemans (an old
English baptismal name), but with these the list is well-nigh
exhausted.&nbsp; Under &ldquo;C&rdquo; the <i>occupative</i>
class is larger than the baptismal.&nbsp; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>This would be
unaccountable did we not remember that there are no less than 283
Cooks and Cookes, 265 Coopers, 221 Carters, 64 Chandlers, 51
Carpenters, and 35 Cartwrights in the Directory.&nbsp; Under
&ldquo;C,&rdquo; too, the <i>official</i> class is very strongly
represented.&nbsp; There are about 520 Clerks, Clarks, and
Clarkes, not to mention 120 Cohens and Cohns (<i>i.e.</i>,
priest), which, though of Jewish origin, are not set down in the
foreign list, inasmuch as the vast majority of them have sprung
from Cohens settled in England for centuries; indeed, a large
number of them pass for pure English blood.&nbsp;
<i>Nicknames</i> are best exhibited under &ldquo;B,&rdquo; for
there are no less than 650 forms of Brown in the London Directory
alone, not to mention 160 Bells and 120 Bishops&mdash;one hundred
and twenty Bishops in London!&nbsp; This beats all the episcopal
conferences of modern times hollow.&nbsp; By-and-by I shall
explain why &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; and such names as
&ldquo;Pope,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cardinal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;King,&rdquo; must be set in the nickname class.&nbsp;
I now may note the fact, and pass on.&nbsp; With respect also to
the 160 Bells, we must not forget that they have three distinct
origins.&nbsp; The following registered forms are found five
hundred years ago:&mdash;&ldquo;Peter le Bel&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>,
the handsome), &ldquo;Richard fil. Bell&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, the
son of Bell, <i>i.e.</i> Isabella), and &ldquo;John atte
Bell&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, at the Bell, the sign-name at some
country hostel).&nbsp; Our friends the Bells may choose which
they like.&nbsp; I should select the first, I think, but tastes
may differ.&nbsp; Again, notice under &ldquo;<i>E</i>&rdquo; that
the <i>baptismal</i> names far outnumber the aggregate of all
other classes, the <i>occupative</i> being without <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>a
representative at all!&nbsp; The popularity of Edward and Elias
(always called Ellis) has done this.&nbsp; There are about 330
Edwards in London; and adding together the different forms of
Ellis, such as Elliot (the pet name of Ellis), Eliot, Elliotson,
Ellice, Ellicot (the pet form of Ellice), Ellison, Elkins,
Elkinson, Elcock, Ell, Else, Elson, and a dozen other dresses in
which the name is arrayed, all of which I shall explain
hereafter, we have no less than 370 representatives of
Elias.&nbsp; That the Crusades brought &ldquo;John&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Elias&rdquo; into favour in England is easily proved, and
I shall have a word to say about the matter in another
chapter.&nbsp; There are a hundred interesting remarks to make
about such names as these, if one allowed oneself to be tempted
out of the beaten track, but I control myself.&nbsp; Notice
lastly, that under &ldquo;D&rdquo; one-tenth of the names are
foreign&mdash;that is, of recent importation from the
Continent.&nbsp; The explanation of such a large proportion is
that very many foreign local surnames preserve the
&ldquo;de,&rdquo; or &ldquo;del,&rdquo; or &ldquo;de la,&rdquo;
as a prefix.&nbsp; &ldquo;De Jersey,&rdquo; &ldquo;De
Grelle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Delattre,&rdquo; &ldquo;Delcroix,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Delavanti;&rdquo;so they run.</p>
<p>In concluding this chapter, the question may be
asked&mdash;and a very important one it is&mdash;how many
differently spelled names, counting a single spelling as one, are
there in each class?&nbsp; The answer to this will show the vast
predominance of local names in our Directories.&nbsp; If we
exclude foreign (nearly all local) and doubtful (of which
three-fifths must be looked upon as local), then the local class
under A, B, C, D, and E, is double all the rest.&nbsp; We <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>may prejudge
that this ratio applies to the whole alphabet.</p>

</table>
<p>Thus the total number of distinct surnames in the London
Directory under the first five letters is 5535.&nbsp; Omitting
foreign and doubtful, the local class are double the rest.&nbsp;
Therefore the rhyme quoted by Camden is true, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In &lsquo;ford,&rsquo; in
&lsquo;ham,&rsquo; in &lsquo;ley,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ton,&rsquo;<br />
The most of English surnames run.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All names with this termination are local, and comprise a
large proportion of our national nomenclature.</p>
<p>One word about the doubtful class, and I have done.&nbsp; A
hundred years ago even, as our registers show, there was no
established orthography for surnames in the highest ranks of
society.&nbsp; How much less so, then, among the illiterate
orders!&nbsp; I find a clergyman&rsquo;s name, Bann, spelled
Bann, Ban, Banne, and Band between 1712 and 1736.&nbsp; He was
Rector of St. Ann&rsquo;s, Manchester, during that period.&nbsp;
The <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>spelling of Shakespear&rsquo;s name at this moment is
the subject of almost bitter conflict.&nbsp; Being clearly of the
nickname class, my view is that it must be written
&ldquo;Shakespear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Illiterate clerks have done much
to obscure the meaning and origin of names.&nbsp; I know a
register where the clerk has written &ldquo;Pickering&rdquo; as
&ldquo;Pikrin,&rdquo; and on the next page informs the reader
that several names have been &ldquo;rong placeed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pamela&rdquo; he inscribes as
&ldquo;Permelea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Butcher is found in the London
Directory in the following forms:&mdash;&ldquo;Boucher,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bowcher,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bowker,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bosher,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bowsher,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bowser,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boutcher,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Botcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Norman &ldquo;Chesney&rdquo;
(equivalent to English &ldquo;Oakes&rdquo;) is found as
&ldquo;Cheney,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chaney,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cheyney,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chesney;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Chesnil&rdquo; as &ldquo;Chisnall,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Chisnell,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Channell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus,
too, &ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Slowman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Sloman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir William Dugdale found the
Cheshire &ldquo;Mainwarings&rdquo; in no less than 131 forms; but
this will not seem so strange when we consider that they include
&ldquo;Mainwayringe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meinilwarin,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Mensilwaren&rdquo;!</p>
<p>I could furnish endless instances of names that have undergone
corruptions of this kind through defective spelling, and the lack
of a standard orthography.&nbsp; Few people would recognise
Oursley as Ursula, but that is a common form in the seventeenth
century, when that was one of our commonest girl names.&nbsp; In
Hokington Church, under date 1611, occurs the following
entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;George, sonne of Fenson Benet, and Jane,
baptised.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A previous Rector had been one Vincent Goodwin, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and being
popular, many of his parishioners had had children christened
after him.&nbsp; The form entered is invariably Fenson, and I
dare say after a generation or two none of the less educated
would know what the original name had been.&nbsp; In the Calendar
of Pleadings we find that one Quintin Snaneton, of Gringley
Manor, made three several suits within ten years&mdash;all in the
reign of Good Queen Bess.&nbsp; He is thus entered on each
occasion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1. (15th Eliz.) Quyntine Sneydon of Gringley
Manor.</p>
<p>2. (20th Eliz.) Quintin Snaneton of Grinley Manor.</p>
<p>3. (25th Eliz.) Quyntin Sneyton of Grynley Manor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus there are three distinct variations of Christian name,
surname, and place of residence,&mdash;nine in all, when only
nine were possible!&nbsp; This, too, in a formal legal
document.&nbsp; Take another instance given to me by J. Paul
Rylands, F.S.A.&nbsp; In Edward the Third&rsquo;s reign lived one
Henry le Machun by name.&nbsp; His son was Adam le Machoun.&nbsp;
Passing downwards, his descendants are found as Macound, Macount,
Macont, till in 1584 they are Macon, a year later Maconde.&nbsp;
In 1592 they are Makant, and Makont, in 1609 Macante, in 1610
Makin, in 1620 Macond, in 1624 Meacon, in 1626 Meakin, in 1644
Macant, in 1650 Meakyn.&nbsp; We are in a perfect wilderness by
the time the last entry is reached,&mdash;and thus some of our
present Makins, instead of deriving their surname from Makin, the
once pet name of Matthew, may be descended from Mason, which,
belonging to a totally different class, owes its existence to the
occupation of its first bearer.&nbsp; Thus, as we turn over <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the pages of
the London Directory, we are being ever struck by the many guises
under which one single name may appear.&nbsp; It is palpable to
the most uninitiated that Langwith, Langworth, and Langworthy are
all the same, and that all <i>may have</i> had the same common
ancestor.&nbsp; The merest tyro in nomenclatural knowledge must
recognise at a glance that Gibbins, Gibbings, and Gibbons are one
and the same name, and that Smithers, Smithies, and Smithyes may
have boasted a common progenitor.&nbsp; There is no Raleigh in
the London Directory.&nbsp; Has, then, Sir Walter no
representative?&nbsp; Yes, for there are three Rawleys, who have
learnt to spell their name as it was <i>pronounced</i> three
centuries ago.&nbsp; But how do we know Sir Walter&rsquo;s name
was pronounced like Rawley?&nbsp; The following skit was written
at the poet&rsquo;s expense by a contemporary critic, who
attacked his supposed atheistic notions.&nbsp; We may premise
that <i>Walter</i> was always pronounced <i>Water</i> then.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Water</i> thy plants with grace
divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hope to live for aye:<br />
Then to thy Saviour Christ incline,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Him make stedfast stay.<br />
<i>Raw</i> is the reason that doth <i>lie</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within an atheist&rsquo;s head,<br />
Which saith the soul of man doth die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When that the body&rsquo;s dead.<br />
Now may you see the sudden fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of him that thought to climb full high;<br />
A man well known unto you all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose state, you see, doth stand
<i>Rawly</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last word is supposed to mean &ldquo;rarely,&rdquo; and
thus a double pun is attempted, both proving the <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>name to have
been pronounced in a fashion not common now.</p>
<p>But while these names can be traced to their true source and
meaning, it is not so with others.&nbsp; Take the following from
the London Directory:&mdash;&ldquo;Six,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spon,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Spitty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kiss,&rdquo; &ldquo;Slape,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Im,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tattoo,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tubby,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yewd,&rdquo; &ldquo;Zox,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Toop,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kitcat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sass,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Knags,&rdquo; &ldquo;Neeb,&rdquo; &ldquo;Siggs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Saks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Toy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stidd,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stap,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shum,&rdquo;&mdash;what do they
mean?&nbsp; Whence came they?&nbsp; Ask the bearers, and they
will say, no doubt, that they came over with William the
Conqueror.&nbsp; They are not the only people who have tried to
come William the Conqueror over us.</p>
<p>In this last list we have mentioned &ldquo;Kiss.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This reminds me that there is one instance in the same tome much
more demonstrative than that&mdash;namely,
&ldquo;Popkiss&rdquo;!&nbsp; But there is no difficulty in
deciphering this, as it is a manifest corruption of Popkins, and
that of Hopkins.&nbsp; The Directory teems with examples of the
termination <i>kins</i> being turned into <i>kiss</i> and again
into <i>ks</i>.&nbsp; Thus we have not merely Perkins, but
Perkiss and Perks&mdash;not only Hodgkins, but
Hotchkiss&mdash;not alone Wilkins, but Wilks; and so oh with many
others.</p>
<p>While some surnames are hopelessly corrupted, and therefore
incapable of interpretation, others are a stumbling-block because
they seem so easily explainable.&nbsp; Such are names like
&ldquo;Coward,&rdquo; &ldquo;Craven,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Charley.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Coward,&rdquo; or
Cowherd, was a tender of kine; &ldquo;Craven&rdquo; is local; and
&ldquo;Charley&rdquo; is the same.&nbsp; &ldquo;Deadman&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Dedman&rdquo; are, like <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>&ldquo;Debnam,&rdquo; but corruptions
of &ldquo;Debenham,&rdquo; and therefore local also.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tiddyman&rdquo; looks as if its first bearer had been tidy
in his habits; but it was once a Christian name, and therefore is
a patronymic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Massinger&rdquo; has been not
uncommonly explained as Mass-singer.&nbsp; Of course it is the
early form of &ldquo;Messenger.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Diamond&rdquo; is a form of &ldquo;Dumont,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Doggrell&rdquo; of &ldquo;Duckerell&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
little duck, a manifest nickname.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eatwell&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Early&rdquo; are also both of local origin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Portwine&rdquo; is first found as &ldquo;Poitevin,&rdquo;
the old name for an inhabitant of Poictiers; and
&ldquo;Coleman,&rdquo; though apparently connected with the black
diamond, is an early baptismal name.&nbsp; There is a peculiar
tendency to skip the natural solution, and go to the Continent,
especially Normandy, for the origin.&nbsp; Thus
&ldquo;Twopenny,&rdquo; a palpable relic of the twopenny piece,
and twopenny ale, is represented as hailing from Tupigny in
Flanders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Death&rdquo; is said to be from
D&rsquo;Aeth in the same; &ldquo;Bridges&rdquo; from Bruges; and
&ldquo;Morley&rdquo; from Morlaix, where lived St.
Bernard&mdash;regardless of the fact that there are a dozen
hamlets styled &ldquo;Morley&rdquo; in England; indeed, wherever
there is a moorland reach there is a village or farm styled
&ldquo;Morley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lady wrote to me the other day to inform me that I had made
a mistake in ascribing the name &ldquo;Mason&rdquo; to the
craftsman of that name, for she was sure she was sprung from
Mnason in the Acts of the Apostles, and that the family had
worked its way through Phrygia, and Italy, and Germany, into
England.&nbsp; If she can prove her pedigree, she may boast a
genealogy which the proudest monarch in <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Europe might
envy.&nbsp; The fact is, it is as true of a hundred reputed
foreign names as of the rhyme of the three Devonshire families,
which asserts that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Croker,&rsquo; &lsquo;Crewys,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Coplestone,&rsquo;<br />
When the Conqueror came were at home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a pleasant book to look upon would our Directory be if we
had all had the selection of our own surnames!&nbsp; There would
have been no &ldquo;Pennyfathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was an old
English nickname for a miser.&nbsp; An old couplet
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The liberall doth spend his pelfe,<br />
The pennyfather wastes himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That such a disposition need not be hereditary is proved in
the case of one of the most generous, earnest Christian ministers
who ever worked for Christ in London.&nbsp; Mr. Pennefather is
dead; but who would think of connecting him with the
characteristic his name implies?&nbsp; Again, there would have
been no &ldquo;Piggs,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Rakestraws&rdquo; (an old
nickname for a dust-heap searcher), no &ldquo;Milksops,&rdquo; no
&ldquo;Buggs,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Rascals.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the fact
is, the man who had most interest in the matter had least to do
with it.&nbsp; All he could do was to accept his sobriquet, if
not with thanks, with such grace as he could muster.&nbsp; If his
children could shuffle it off, so much the better.&nbsp; Our
Directory proves that this was not always possible.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true, we have got rid of &ldquo;Alan
Swet-in-bedde&rsquo;s&rdquo; <i>nominal</i> descendants, not to
mention such cognomens as &ldquo;Cheese-and-bread,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Scutel-mouth&rdquo; (what a great eater he must have
been!) <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;Red-herring,&rdquo; &ldquo;Drink-dregs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s-nose,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pigg&rsquo;s-flesh,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Spickfat&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> bacon-fat),
&ldquo;Burgulion&rdquo; (a braggart), and
&ldquo;Rattlebag.&rdquo;&nbsp; But many of these names made a
hard fight for it, and contrived to hold out till the
seventeenth, or even eighteenth, century.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Piggs-flesh,&rdquo; I say, is gone; but
&ldquo;Hog&rsquo;s-flesh&rdquo; has been a name familiar to
Brighton and its neighbourhood for six hundred years, and still
lives.&nbsp; Charles Lamb&rsquo;s little comedy, called
&ldquo;Mr. H.&mdash;&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, Hog&rsquo;s-flesh), had
for its hero&rsquo;s sobriquet no fanciful title.&nbsp; No doubt
Mr. Lamb had seen the name in a Sussex Directory.&nbsp; The story
is a relation of Mr. H.&rsquo;s troubles in polite society
through the attempt to hide his name under the mere
initial.&nbsp; When it is discovered, everybody deserts
him.&nbsp; As he quits his hotel, his landlord says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hope your honour does not intend to quit
the &lsquo;Blue <i>Boar</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sorry anything has
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i> (to himself): &ldquo;He has heard it
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;Your honour has had some mortification,
to be sure, as a man may say.&nbsp; You have brought your pigs to
a fine market.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;Pigs!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;What then?&nbsp; Take old Pry&rsquo;s
advice, and never mind it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t scorch your
crackling for &rsquo;em, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;Scorch my crackling!&nbsp; A queer
phrase; but I suppose he don&rsquo;t mean to affront
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;What is done can&rsquo;t be undone; you
can&rsquo;t make a silken purse out of a sow&rsquo;s
ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;As you say, landlord, thinking of a
thing does but augment it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;Does but <i>hogment</i> it, indeed,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;<i>Hogment</i> it!&nbsp; I said
<i>augment</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;Ah, sir, &rsquo;tis not everybody has
such gift of fine phrases as your honour, that can lard his
discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;Lard!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;Suppose they do smoke
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;Smoke me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>: &ldquo;Anon, anon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. H.</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I wish I were anonymous!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is curious to notice that many objectionable names still
exist, simply because the words themselves have become obsolete,
and the meaning forgotten.&nbsp; We will leave them in their
obscurity.</p>

41</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">said</span> in my last chapter that
nearly half of the names in the London Directory are of local
origin, and I proved my statement by an appeal to certain
figures.&nbsp; We have not all the brand of Cain on our brow, but
certainly man has ever been &ldquo;a fugitive and a vagabond in
the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; History, sacred and profane, teems with
the records of the flights of nations from one land to
another.&nbsp; From the days of the Israelites&rsquo; escape from
Egypt to the flight of the Huguenots from France, there have been
emigrations which have been the direct results of
persecution.&nbsp; From the year that saw Babel erected and the
language confounded, the races of mankind have struck out a path
for themselves in one direction or another of the earth&rsquo;s
vast continent.&nbsp; The curious feature is this,&mdash;It is to
the <i>dictionary</i> we must go to discover whence each several
horde set forth.&nbsp; The <i>language</i> <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of every
nation clearly tells where lies the cradle of its birth.</p>
<p>But emigration and immigration lie not alone with
nationalities.&nbsp; The world has not always been a vagabond
<i>en masse</i>.&nbsp; From the day that Jacob started for the
East to find his uncle, from the morn that saw Ruth clinging to
Naomi, while she said, &ldquo;Whither thou goest I will go, and
where thou lodgest I will lodge,&rdquo; there has ever been going
on a wondrous silent efflux or influx of <i>individual</i>
wanderers.&nbsp; Just as the mother-bird at the proper time, with
seeming stern but true maternal instinct, pushes out her
fledgling brood to seek a home and sustenance for themselves, so
it has ever been with man.&nbsp; To go forth and replenish the
earth has been a Divine fiat which none could forego.&nbsp; And
what the <i>dictionary</i> is to the nation, the <i>directory</i>
is to the individual.&nbsp; In the name of each we know the land,
the city, the hamlet, whence each set forward to battle with the
world.&nbsp; At any rate, this is strictly true of all local
surnames.</p>
<p>In the course of the last six hundred years there has not been
a single village or town in England that has not found its
representative in London.&nbsp; &ldquo;All roads lead to the
capital,&rdquo; says an old proverb.&nbsp; How true this is, the
London Directory shows; for at this moment it would be hard to
mention a place, big or small, from John o&rsquo; Groats to
Land&rsquo;s End,&mdash;the Dan and Beersheba of
England,&mdash;whose name is not found therein as the title of
some individual whose ancestor, long generations ago, left his
native home to settle in what was, even then, the big city.&nbsp;
I was struck the <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>other day by seeing two shops adjacent, the
shopkeepers&rsquo; names on the doors being
&ldquo;Dearnally&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dennerley.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dearnally and Dennerley!&nbsp; What a curious circumstance!&nbsp;
My mind went back six centuries, and I wove a little story.&nbsp;
Six hundred years ago, two brothers, or schoolfellows, or
playmates, leave the little secluded hamlet of Dearnley. <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a>&nbsp; One is John, the other
William.&nbsp; John goes to Bristol.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence come
you?&rdquo; say his Bristol associates.&nbsp; &ldquo;From
Dearnley,&rdquo; he replies.&nbsp; Henceforward he is John
o&rsquo; Dearnley, by-and-by to become simple John
Dearnley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo; says a Norwich
artisan to William, who has turned his steps eastwards.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From Dearnley: I wonder shall I see it again,&rdquo;
responds William, sadly, who is already home-sick,&mdash;for
homes were homes then as well as now.&nbsp; Henceforth he is
William o&rsquo; Dearnley, or Will Dearnley.&nbsp; Each marries,
has children, dies.&nbsp; His descendants, bearing his name, are
scattered hither and thither over the broad land, like leaves
before the cold keen blast of an October wind.&nbsp; Corruptions
of the name of course ensue.&nbsp; The descendants of John are
&ldquo;Dearnally&rdquo;; of William
&ldquo;Dennerley.&rdquo;&nbsp; Centuries after this, in the year
of grace 1877, one of John&rsquo;s generation, who has found his
way to a big city, sees a new house, takes it, is a grocer, and
inscribes his name Dearnally above.&nbsp; In the meantime another
stranger is eyeing a contiguous shop in the same block of
buildings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fine opening for a butcher <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>here,&rdquo;
says he to himself: &ldquo;I will take these
premises.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does so.&nbsp; Up goes his name.&nbsp;
What is it?&nbsp; Dennerley!&nbsp; Thus, after long years, nay,
centuries, two descendants of the two playfellows, probably
brothers, are to be seen dwelling together, each ignorant that
when he wishes his neighbour good morning, he is rejoining links
in a chain snapped, oh, so long ago!&nbsp; The invisible
destinies of God have recovered the lost associations of twenty
generations!&nbsp; Said I not, the London Directory is a
romance?</p>
<p>I have selected this story for a purpose.&nbsp; It explains
the origin of every local surname in existence.&nbsp; A man, in a
new community to which he had joined himself, might go by the
name of his occupation, as &ldquo;Tinker,&rdquo; or
father&rsquo;s Christian name, as &ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; or by a
nickname from his social habits, as &ldquo;Good-fellow&rdquo;;
but in five cases out of ten he bore the title of the spot whence
he issued forth.&nbsp; Take a few instances of the mode and
manner in which these local surnames were formed.&nbsp; All my
illustrations shall be from the London Directory.&nbsp; For
perspicuity&rsquo;s sake I will separate them into classes.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; <i>Local names terminating in</i>
&ldquo;<i>er</i>&rdquo; <i>and</i>
&ldquo;<i>man</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Churchman&rdquo; would
seem to bespeak the original possessor an Episcopalian.&nbsp; But
there was no dissent in the twelfth or thirteenth century.&nbsp;
It could give no individuality as such.&nbsp; It was a local
name, implying that John or Peter Churchman dwelt by the
church.&nbsp; Hence also &ldquo;Churcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
north, &ldquo;Church&rdquo; was pronounced
&ldquo;Kirk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, in the north these two names
are found as &ldquo;Kirkman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Kirker,&rdquo;&mdash;exactly as we find
&ldquo;Thacker&rdquo; in <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Yorkshire to be
&ldquo;Thatcher&rdquo; in Surrey.&nbsp; Of this same class are
Crosser and Crossman, reminding us that there was a time in
pre-Reformation days when every village had its cross, which was
as much a landmark as it was an object of reverence.&nbsp;
Bridger and Bridgman lived beside the wooden or stone structure
that spanned the stream.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; <i>Some local names still preserve the affix
or suffix</i> corresponding to the French &ldquo;del,&rdquo;
&ldquo;de,&rdquo; &ldquo;du,&rdquo; and &ldquo;de la,&rdquo; as
Atwood, Atwater, and Atwell, once William <i>at the</i> wood, or
<i>at the</i> water, or <i>at the</i> well.&nbsp; <i>By</i> is
found in Bywater, and Bythesea.&nbsp; Sometimes the letter
&ldquo;n&rdquo; got in for euphony&rsquo;s sake, as in
&ldquo;Nash,&rdquo; which is sprung from
&ldquo;atten-ash.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thomas atte-n-ash&rdquo;
thus became Thomas Nash.&nbsp; Hence Nolt for atte-n-holt
(<i>i.e.</i> wood), or Nalder for &ldquo;Alder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Townsend is from Town&rsquo;s-end.&nbsp; Thus Peter at the
Town&rsquo;s-end becomes Peter Townsend, or Townshend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tash&rdquo; is from &ldquo;at the Ash&rdquo;; and Thynne,
a name belonging to one of our ennobled families, is said to be
from one &ldquo;John at the Inne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; <i>Most of these generic names have dropped
all suffixes and affixes</i>.&nbsp; Here a hundred surnames
present themselves to our eye.&nbsp; Who does not know a Hill or
Dale, a Field or Croft?&nbsp; Who has not a friend called Craig
or Cliff, or Dean or Hope?&nbsp; Who has not met with a Grange or
Moor, or Wood or Shaw?&nbsp; Our &ldquo;Streets&rdquo; are as
thick as Our &ldquo;Lanes,&rdquo; and in the busiest
thoroughfares of London you may descry Barnes and Marshes and
Parks and Forests and Warrens without end.&nbsp; The village
spring has given us our &ldquo;Wells,&rdquo; the village road our
&ldquo;Crosses,&rdquo; <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and the village common has given us
our &ldquo;Greens.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following was addressed to a
Miss Green on her fortieth birthday:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That evergreen thy graces show;<br />
Some men say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and some say &lsquo;No.&rsquo;<br
/>
Alas! that one and all agree<br />
That ever-Green thy name shall be!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greener is common, being formed after the fashion of Knowler
and Knowlman, and Streeter and Streetman, (<i>vide</i> under
&ldquo;<i>a</i>&rdquo;).&nbsp; A Mr. Greener being devoted
admirer of a Miss Green, wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One dearest wish I fondly cherish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My ever-Green so fair, yet lonely:<br />
To make thee mine, and thus thou&rsquo;lt flourish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Greener, and Greener only.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which she responded,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Green indeed; but Greener
thou,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To think by love declarative,<br />
To make me change charms <i>positive</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For those at best <i>comparative</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flood and Fell belong to this same class, except when Flood is
Welsh, and then, like Floyd, it is the same as Lloyd.&nbsp; A Mr.
Isaac Fell is said to have had painted over his shop, in very
legible characters, &ldquo;I. Fell, from Ludgate Hill&rdquo;;
beneath which, one day, a Shakspearian wag wrote, &ldquo;O what a
fall was there, my countrymen!&rdquo;&nbsp; We have mentioned
&ldquo;Dean&rdquo; above.&nbsp; In composition it generally
appears as &ldquo;den,&rdquo; and implies a sheltered and sunken
glade closely surrounded with trees.&nbsp; Hence it was a covert
for cattle and wild beasts, and many of the names <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>we now see
bear out the fact.&nbsp; Not merely do we talk of a &ldquo;den of
lions,&rdquo; but we descry dens of &ldquo;hogs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;rams,&rdquo; &ldquo;oxen,&rdquo; &ldquo;kine,&rdquo; and
even &ldquo;wolves,&rdquo; in such surnames as Ogden, Ramsden,
Oxenden, Cowden, and Wolvenden.&nbsp; Other compounds of
&ldquo;den&rdquo; are not so easily discernible.&nbsp; What
Heberden may mean I do not know.&nbsp; There is still in the
Directory one Heberden, a physician.&nbsp; Probably it was his
father, or grandfather, one of three great London doctors in
George the Third&rsquo;s reign, of whom the <i>sixain</i> got
abroad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You should send, if aught should ail ye,<br
/>
For Willis, Heberden, or Baillie:<br />
All exceeding skilful men,<br />
Baillie, Willis, Heberden:<br />
Uncertain which most sure to kill is,<br />
Baillie, Heberden, or Willis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Moore or &ldquo;More,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Moor,&rdquo;
represented until late in London by George Moore, whose like we
do not expect to see soon again, has been a butt for the shafts
of wit for generations.&nbsp; We could fill the remaining pages
of this chapter with &ldquo;torts and retorts&rdquo; upon this
sobriquet.&nbsp; Lorenzo, in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, says,
&ldquo;It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I
took her for;&rdquo; to which Launcelot replies irately,
&ldquo;How every fool can play upon the word!&rdquo;&nbsp; But
some of these epigrams are not fools&rsquo; work,
nevertheless.&nbsp; When Sir Thomas More was Chancellor, his
untiring devotion to his office brought a conclusion to all the
Chancery cases in litigation.&nbsp; The following got
abroad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;When More some years had Chancellor been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more suits did remain;<br />
The same shall never more be seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till More be there again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Dr. Manners-Sutton succeeded Archbishop Moore, this rhyme
appeared:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What say you? the Archbishop&rsquo;s
dead?<br />
A loss indeed!&nbsp; Oh, on his head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May Heaven its blessings pour;<br />
But if with such a heart and mind,<br />
In Manners we his equal find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should we wish for Moore?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might mention other similar attempts at rhymical puns on
this name; but let this epitaph from St. Bennet&rsquo;s
Churchyard, Paul&rsquo;s Wharf, London, suffice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies one More, and no more than he;<br
/>
One More, and no more! how can that be?<br />
Why, one More, and no more may well lie here alone,<br />
But here lies one More, and that&rsquo;s more than
one!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this generic class belongs every name that suggests the
familiar objects of the country.&nbsp; Even the trees supply
their quota.&nbsp; Who is not aware of Mr. Harper
Twelvetrees&rsquo; existence, and cannot see that his ancestor
having made his abode beside some remarkable group of birch or
oak or chestnut trees, has been styled by his neighbours
&ldquo;Peter atte Twelve-trees&rdquo;?&nbsp; Hence the French
&ldquo;Quatrefages,&rdquo; and more English
&ldquo;Crabtree,&rdquo; &ldquo;Plumtree,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Plumptree,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rountree&rdquo; (once written
&ldquo;Rowantree&rdquo;), &ldquo;Appletree,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Peartree.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these names still exist, and I
find entries to prove they lived at least six hundred years
ago.&nbsp; To many of my readers it may <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>seem somewhat
strange that a single shrub should be pressed into the service of
nomenclature in this manner.&nbsp; But let him imagine himself
<i>without a surname</i>, living in the country, in a lane, with
no landmark adjacent but a stile, or an oak, or an ash.&nbsp;
<i>How could he escape</i> being called by his neighbours John
Styles, or Oakes, or Ash?&nbsp; If there were no trees, nor even
a stile, how could he avoid being designated as John in the Lane,
and finally John Lane?&nbsp; Snooks might be set by
&ldquo;Twelvetrees,&rdquo; for it is but a corruption of
&ldquo;Sennoks&rdquo; and that of &ldquo;Sevenoaks,&rdquo; a
well-known place in Kent.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; The next division of local names is
<i>specific</i>&mdash;viz. the names of towns or villages, such
as Preston, Buxton, Oldham, Lancaster, Chester, York, and indeed
all that class so multitudinous of which the old distich already
quoted says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In <i>ford</i>, in <i>ham</i>, in
<i>ley</i>, in <i>ton</i>,<br />
The most of English surnames run.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the &ldquo;ley&rdquo; gets corrupted.&nbsp; There
can be little doubt, for instance, that Hathaway is but a
mispronunciation of Hatherley, and that Ann Hathaway&rsquo;s
progenitor hailed from Gloucestershire.&nbsp; Was ever a more
beautiful as well as clever punning rhyme made than that imputed
to Shakespear?&nbsp; One verse must suffice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Would ye be taught, ye feathered throng,<br
/>
With Love&rsquo;s sweet notes to grace your song,<br />
To pierce the heart with thrilling lay?<br />
Listen to mine Ann Hathaway!<br />
She hath a way to sing so clear,<br />
Ph&oelig;bus might wondering stop to hear:<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>To melt
the sad, make blithe the gay,<br />
And Nature charm, Ann hath a way:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hath a way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann Hathaway,<br />
To breathe delight, Ann hath a way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five Hathaways and three Hathways still commemorate her in the
Directory.&nbsp; The termination &ldquo;field&rdquo; is corrupted
into the form of &ldquo;full&rdquo; in several cases; thus
Charles Hatfull&rsquo;s name reads somewhat queerly.&nbsp; Of
course he belongs to the Hatfields who figure just above him.</p>
<p>See the tendency to migrate <i>into</i>, and not <i>from</i>
London.&nbsp; The name London is rare, as the Directory
shows.&nbsp; A man leaving Buxton for the capital, would be
Walter-o&rsquo;-Buxton; quitting the capital for the Peak of
Derbyshire, he would be Walter-o&rsquo;-London.&nbsp; But the
tendency being for a young aspirant after fame and wealth to go
<i>thither</i>, and not <i>thence</i>, made the surname London of
rare occurrence.&nbsp; Perhaps there has been more than one
Whittington who has fancied the bells have bid him stay and try
his luck again in that big centre of life and industry, whose
title is the most familiar place-name in the world.&nbsp; Curious
that the mightiest city of the mightiest empire should be so
scantily represented in its own Directory.&nbsp; The cause, as I
have shown, is simple of explanation.&nbsp; We may here set
&ldquo;New,&rdquo; &ldquo;Newman,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Strange.&rdquo;&nbsp; A new comer would easily get the
sobriquet of &ldquo;Matthew the New-man,&rdquo; or &ldquo;William
the Strange,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Henry the New,&rdquo; in the fresh
community to which he had joined himself.&nbsp; The sobriquet has
stuck to his children, and still remains.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>(<i>e</i>)&nbsp; <i>Names of foreign towns</i>, the
result of earlier or later immigration, come next: such as
&ldquo;Cullen&rdquo; from Cologne, a name very familiar to
English Roman Catholics; &ldquo;Lyons&rdquo; from the city
devoted to the silk trade; &ldquo;Bullen&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Boleyn&rdquo; from Boulogne; or &ldquo;Janeway&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Jannaway&rdquo; from Genoa.</p>
<p>Many of these foreign town-names came into England through the
fact that the towns they represented were celebrated for some
particular production.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Challens&rdquo; of our
Directory all hail from Chalons, once so famous for its blankets
that they were called &ldquo;chalons&rdquo; for several
centuries.&nbsp; The name still lingers in the woollen trade of
Yorkshire as &ldquo;shaloon cloth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chaucer speaks
both of &ldquo;chalons&rdquo; and &ldquo;cloth of
raines.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was made at Rennes in Brittany, and has
furnished the London Directory with its various Rains, Rain,
Raine, and Raines.&nbsp; A writer in the &ldquo;Book of
Days&rdquo; says the following was written upon a lady bearing
the name of Rain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whilst shiv&rsquo;ring beaux at weather
rail,<br />
Of frost, and snow, and wind, and hail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heat, and cold, complain,<br />
My steadier mind is always bent<br />
On one sole object of content,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ever wish for Rain!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hymen, thy votary&rsquo;s praise attend,<br />
His anxious hope and suit befriend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him not ask in vain:<br />
His thirsty soul, his parched estate,<br />
His glowing breast commiserate&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In pity give him Rain!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp; <i>Names of counties</i> naturally follow the
last class: as Derbyshire, or Kent, or Lancashire, or <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Cumberland,
or Kentish, or Devonish, or Cornish, or Cornwall.&nbsp; A new
comer would easily get a sobriquet of this sort after stepping
across the border line of two contiguous shires.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>)&nbsp; <i>Names of countries and nationalities</i>
may fitly be set last: as Ireland, Scott, Welsh, Walsh, Wallace,
English.&nbsp; These, of course, are marks of migration.&nbsp; If
an Englishman went into Scotland he would be Peter the English,
or Inglis; or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, he would be Peter the
Scot.&nbsp; Foreign districts are represented by such names as
&ldquo;Britton&rdquo; from Brittany, &ldquo;Burgon,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Burgoyne,&rdquo; from Burgundy, &ldquo;Gaskin&rdquo; from
Gascony, and so on with French, Holland, Fleming, and Aleman or
Alman, the old name for Germany.&nbsp; The French form for this
latter is &ldquo;D&rsquo;Almaine,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Lallimand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both have found their way to
London; thus showing a double immigration, first from Germany to
France, and then from France to England.&nbsp; Our Sarasins and,
Sarsons (when not metronymics for Sara-son, <i>i.e.</i>
Sarah&rsquo;s son) are interesting relics of crusading times,
when the Templar loved to bring back with him a young Saracen boy
to act as his page.&nbsp; The name is enrolled as
&ldquo;Sarracen&rdquo; in many ancient registers.&nbsp; Turk also
exists.&nbsp; A &ldquo;William le Turk&rdquo; lived in London
just four hundred years ago, and four &ldquo;Turks&rdquo; may be
seen in the Directory to-day.&nbsp; The Rev. Richard Thorpe,
incumbent of Christ Church, Camberwell, married Thomas Turk to
Jane Russ on October 26th, 1877, during the negotiations for
peace at Constantinople.&nbsp; How one wishes that such a hopeful
union might be brought about between the nations represented by
the names of this <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>pair!&nbsp; It is fair to add, that in this case
&ldquo;Russ&rdquo; is merely a corruption of &ldquo;Rous,&rdquo;
or of &ldquo;Rouse,&rdquo; red-haired or
ruddy-complexioned&mdash;a favourite nickname with our
forefathers.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;Rowses&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Russells&rdquo; are of similar origin.</p>
<p>One name in the London Directory deserves a paragraph to
itself, and also to be classified alone, if one single sobriquet
can be said to comprise a class.&nbsp; This remarkable surname is
&ldquo;World.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a cosmopolitan the ancestor of
the bearer of this title must have been!&nbsp; Mr. Bowditch, an
American writer on surnames, has recorded an instance in the
Western continent, for he says, &ldquo;Columbus discovered a
world, and so have I.&nbsp; Mr. World lives at
Orilla.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sobriquet of course is a corruption, but
of what I cannot say.</p>
<p>We might go on like Tennyson&rsquo;s brook, &ldquo;for
ever,&rdquo; in this chat over local names,&mdash;but
enough.&nbsp; We have only left ourselves space to remind the
reader what vagrants we all are.&nbsp; Like Dickens&rsquo; little
street boy (in &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; I think it is), there
seems ever to be a shadowy policeman at our elbow bidding us to
&ldquo;move on.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bible has foretold that this is
to be our condition; and our names, at least those of local
origin, have impressed on our very foreheads the truth of such a
Divine prophecy.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well it should be so.&nbsp;
Earth is not to be our dwelling-place for ever.&nbsp; And though
at times we may feel that we should like repose, it is in mercy
that God applies the goad, for thus are we reminded
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our rest is in Heaven, our rest is not
here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day will assuredly dawn for the Christian when <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>he shall be
enabled to take off his travel-worn shoes, when he shall enter
into the home to which he has been making his way through so many
weary stages, and from which there shall be no going forth, even
for ever and for ever.&nbsp; May every reader of this chapter be
amongst that multitude of &ldquo;vagabonds in the earth,&rdquo;
to use a Scripture phrase, who shall then &ldquo;enter His gates
with thanksgiving, and His courts with praise.&rdquo;</p>

55</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROBIN HOOD AND THE LONDON
DIRECTORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> largest class of surnames in
the London Directory, we showed in our second chapter, after
local names, were those of patronymic origin: baptismal surnames
we called them.&nbsp; If Richard has a son called Richard, it is
easy to suppose that this child would go by the name of Richard
Richard&rsquo;s son, or Richard Dick&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; A third
generation having appeared in the form of a grandson, called
Richard, after father or grandfather, it will be readily supposed
that, he being also Richard Richard&rsquo;s son, or Dick&rsquo;s
son, the surname Richardson would now be sufficiently
familiarised to become the <i>hereditary</i> cognomen of the
descendants of this stock.&nbsp; Thus Richardson and Dickson have
sprung into being.&nbsp; Thus every name of this class has
originated.&nbsp; Names like Johnson, Jackson, Timpson, Wilson,
Harrison, or Stephenson, simply prove that the bearers of these
several titles <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>are descended from some particular John, Tim, Will,
Harry, or Stephen, who when he died bequeathed his baptismal name
as a piece of property to his immediate descendants&mdash;not
deliberately, as he would his money and estates, but in the
casual and accidental fashion recorded above.</p>
<p>We can understand that at first it would seem strange for a
<i>girl</i> to go by a patronymic of this kind.&nbsp; Imagine at
this early stage of surname formation some village maid bearing
the name of Mary William<i>son</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Mary, the son of
William)!&nbsp; To us, accustomed to these names, there seems
nothing absurd in such a title as Matilda John<i>son</i>, or
Margaret David<i>son</i>.&nbsp; It never occurs to us to take the
name to pieces, and see the incongruity of its several
elements.&nbsp; That this was a difficulty to our forefathers is
evident from the fact that there are many entries like
&ldquo;Joan Willsdaughter,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nan
Tomsdaughter,&rdquo; in the registers of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries.&nbsp; Thus &ldquo;Isabella
Peersdoghter&rdquo; lived near Durham four hundred years
ago&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Isabella, the daughter of Peers,
<i>i.e.</i> Peter.&nbsp; In the same way, &ldquo;Avice
Mattwife&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Avice, the wife of Matt
(Matthew)&mdash;or &ldquo;Cecilia Wilkin-wife,&rdquo; is found at
the same period.&nbsp; The reason why surnames ending in
<i>daughter</i> are not found now, is that if the girl with such
a surname died unmarried, it died with her; if she married, she
changed her name.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Son</i>,&rdquo; as a
termination having no difficulties of this kind to contend with,
has left us a multitude of names.&nbsp; Had it been otherwise, we
should have had surnames like Steven-daughter, Dick-daughter, and
Hopkin-daughter, contending for <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a place in our directories with
&ldquo;Stevenson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dickson,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hopkinson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would seem as if the female sex, therefore, had been hardly
treated in this matter of baptismal nomenclature.&nbsp; Indeed,
some of my readers might be tempted to ask me whether the gentler
half of the community are represented at all in our
directories.&nbsp; I am happy to respond in the
affirmative.&nbsp; John and Margery might have a son, Robert by
name.&nbsp; Now, John is a timid, retiring kind of man; his wife
being a bustling, active, assertive woman.&nbsp; John sits in the
chimney-corner, Margery does all the marketing, all the talking,
possibly all the working also.&nbsp; In a word, she rules the
roost.&nbsp; Naturally, the neighbours get into a way of calling
the child &ldquo;Robert <i>Margeri</i>son,&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;Robert <i>John</i>son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Margerison, Margetson,
and Margetts are all in the London Directory.&nbsp; Take another
instance: Hodge and Nell get married; Hodge dies, and a
posthumous child is born.&nbsp; Only the mother is living.&nbsp;
As a matter of course, the little one is styled Antony or Sarah
<i>Nel</i>son, according to its sex.&nbsp; A large number of
metronymic surnames must be attributed to an accident of this
kind.&nbsp; All our &ldquo;Ibbs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ibbisons,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ibbsons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ibbots,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ibbotsons&rdquo; are sprung from Isabella, a much more
common and familiar name four or five hundred years ago than it
is now.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;Emmetts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Emmotts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Emmotsons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Emms,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Empsons&rdquo; are descendants of some &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Emmot,&rdquo; as she was then styled.&nbsp; Many people
have refused to believe that there are any metronymic surnames,
for fear that it would <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>seem to imply illegitimate
birth.&nbsp; It is always silly to deny facts, and I have shown
there is no reason to dread the charge in the great majority of
these instances.</p>
<p>Every nation has its own peculiar way of forming the baptismal
surname.&nbsp; We have no less than five representing British as
distinct from English nomenclature: Anglo-Norman, Anglo-Saxon,
Scotch, Irish, and Welsh.&nbsp; Each had his fashion of framing
the patronymic, and all, I need not say, abound in the
metropolis.&nbsp; The Norman made <i>fitz</i> (French,
<i>fils</i>) a prefix, and thus Gilbert, son of Hamon, became
Gilbert Fitz-hamon.&nbsp; The Saxon made <i>son</i> a desinence,
and thus Ralph, son of Nichol, became Ralph
Nichol<i>son</i>.&nbsp; The Welshman put <i>ap</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
son) in the forefront, like the Norman, and thus Owen ap-Richard
became Owen Pritchard, or Griffin ap-Harry Griffin Parry, or Hugh
ap-Rice Hugh Price.&nbsp; The inhabitant of &ldquo;Caledonia
stern and wild&rdquo; also set <i>Mac</i> at the beginning rather
than the end, so that Andrew, son of Aulay, became Andrew
Macaulay.&nbsp; Lastly, our friends of the Emerald Isle prefixed
<i>Mac</i> or <i>O</i> to the baptismal name, as their form of
descent, and thus Patrick, son of Neale, became Patrick MacNeale,
or Patrick O&rsquo;Neale.&nbsp; As the old rhyme has it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By <i>Mac</i> and <i>O</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You all may know<br />
True Irishmen, they say;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But if they lack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both <i>O</i> and <i>Mac</i>,<br />
No Irishmen are they.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus within the boundary lines of our own Britannic realm we
have &ldquo;<i>son</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>fitz</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>ap</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Mac</i>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>O</i>&rdquo; <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>employed in the formation of one
single class of surnames.&nbsp; Sometimes the Welsh
&ldquo;<i>ap</i>&rdquo; became &ldquo;<i>ab</i>,&rdquo; and thus
ap-Evan has become &ldquo;Bevan,&rdquo; ap-Owen, Bowen,
ap-Ethell, Bethell, and ap-Huggins, Buggins.&nbsp; In the same
way, ap-Lloyd is found in the London Directory as Bloyd.</p>
<p>There are about five thousand people in London bearing names
of which &ldquo;Robert&rdquo; is the root and foundation.&nbsp; I
wonder if it has ever struck my reader that the <i>nominal</i>
existence of four-fifths of this large population is the result
of the life, adventures, and celebrity of that great outlaw Robin
Hood.&nbsp; To gather up the links of evidence would fill a
volume.&nbsp; I will occupy the remainder of this chapter by a
brief <i>resum&eacute;</i> of the argument.&nbsp; If I prove my
assertion, this will be demonstrating the reality of my title,
and show conclusively that the London Directory may be well
styled a &ldquo;romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Robin Hood was the fictitious name of Robert, Earl of
Huntingdon, has been proved an idle fable; but although there are
serious doubts as to the existence of William Tell, there need be
none as to the individuality of Robin Hood.&nbsp; That a noted
forester&mdash;an outlaw&mdash;of this name roved in the
neighbourhood of Sherwood during the first four decades of the
thirteenth century, is beyond dispute.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Locksley town, in merry
Nottinghamshire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In merry sweet Locksley town,<br />
There bold Robin Hood was born and was bred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bold Robin of famous renown.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He and his companions lived by spoil.&nbsp; His popularity was
twofold in origin.&nbsp; He was credited with <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>a spirit of
liberty chafing against an oppressive and tyrannic rule.&nbsp; He
was equally credited, truly or the reverse, with unbounded
kindness to the poor.&nbsp; Camden styles him
&ldquo;<i>pr&aelig;donem mitissimum</i>,&rdquo; the gentlest of
thieves.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott says of the spoil he heaped up,
that he &ldquo;shook the superflux to the poor,&rdquo; and, in
respect of government, &ldquo;showed the heavens more
just.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dying about the year 1247, it was not very
long before he became an &ldquo;institution&rdquo;: every country
ballad, every chapbook had its story of Robin Hood, his princely
spirit, his skill in archery, his wondrous adventures, and his
hair-breadth escapes.&nbsp; The impression that he was of noble
birth only added to his popularity.</p>
<p>This of course could not but have its effect upon the
nomenclature of the time.&nbsp; It is well known that when Thomas
&agrave; Beckett was murdered, almost every child born
immediately afterwards was, if a boy, christened Thomas.&nbsp; To
this tragedy myriads of Thompsons and Tomlinsons owe their
surnames.&nbsp; The dictionary and the directory are under equal
obligations to Robin Hood.&nbsp; There need be little doubt that
Gough&rsquo;s suggestion that his real name was &ldquo;Robin
o&rsquo; the Wood&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Sherwood) is true.&nbsp;
The corruption &ldquo;Hood&rdquo; is perfectly natural.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Look at some of our <i>place-names</i>.&nbsp; In
1730 there was a &ldquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; about
three miles north of Doncaster; and Leland, the great itinerary,
visited &ldquo;Robyn Hudd&rsquo;s Bay,&rdquo; under which antique
dress we recognise the familiar village and coast &ldquo;Robin
Hood&rsquo;s Bay,&rdquo; betwixt Whitby and Scarborough.&nbsp; <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Everybody has
seen a Robin Hood&rsquo;s oak, or a Robin Hood&rsquo;s
bower.&nbsp; At this moment there are hundreds of country inns in
the north, called &ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo; with a picture of the
bold archer in dress proper, or intended to be so, to the period
in which he is supposed to have lived.&nbsp; His bow and arrow
are of course always depicted, and occasionally a deer in the
distance.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Look at the old English <i>proverbs</i>; and we may
premise that if a man has created a proverb he has made himself
immortal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good even, Robin Hood,&rdquo; quoted by
Skelton, poet-laureate to Henry VIII., implied &ldquo;civility
extorted by fear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fuller quotes, &ldquo;Many men
talk of Robin Hood that neere shott in his bow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To over-shoot Robin Hood,&rdquo; is another proverbial
saying.&nbsp; This is quoted by Sir Philip Sidney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tales of Robin Hood are good for fools,&rdquo; is quoted
by Camden.&nbsp; The most familiar, however, was &ldquo;to sell
Robin Hood&rsquo;s pennyworths.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fuller refers to
this as of things half sold, half given; the great robber parting
lightly with what he came by lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Robin&rsquo;s
choice,&rdquo; this or nothing, would seem almost to have
suggested &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; for Hobson is a
patronymic of Robert, Hob being the old familiar pet name for the
same.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; To Robin Hood, again, we doubtless owe the
familiarity of several names applied to the <i>spirit
world</i>.&nbsp; Our forefathers were very superstitious,
especially the country peasantry.&nbsp; A belief in
&ldquo;brownies,&rdquo; &ldquo;dobbies,&rdquo;
&ldquo;pixies,&rdquo; and elves kindly or mischievous, still
largely prevails in places removed from the busy towns.&nbsp;
Superstitions of this kind die where men <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>are herded
together.&nbsp; It is only in dusky woodlands ghostly sights
appear, or in the silences of the rural churchyard or forest
avenue that voices are heard whose utterance is not from human
throat!&nbsp; Certainly Robin Hood must stand sponsor for much of
the dread that nurses infused into naughty children&rsquo;s
breasts.&nbsp; The pet names or nurses&rsquo; names of Robert
were &ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hob,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Dob.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>ignis fatuus</i>, to this day an
object of apprehension, was associated early with the bold
freebooter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some call him <i>Robin Goodfellow</i>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Hob-goblin</i>, or mad Crisp.<br />
And some againe doe terme him oft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By name of Will the Wispe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So says an old ballad.&nbsp; <i>Robin</i> Goodfellow and
<i>Hob</i>-goblin, it will be seen, represent the same
name.&nbsp; Another title for the same was
&ldquo;Hob-lanthorn&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Robin&rsquo;s
lanthorn).&nbsp; Dr. Halliwell gives the term
&ldquo;Hob-thrush,&rdquo; adding that it is always used in
association with Robin Goodfellow.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Two
Lancashire Lovers&rdquo; (1640) it is said, &ldquo;If he be no
hob-thrush, nor no Robin Goodfellow, I could finde with all my
heart to sip up a sillybub with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, then, are
four names, &ldquo;Robin Goodfellow,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hob-goblin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hob-lanthorn,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hob-thrush;&rdquo; all used to give personation to that
curious light which occasionally may be seen in marshy and woody
districts.&nbsp; How natural that these should be associated with
that mysterious denizen of the forest, whose name was in
everybody&rsquo;s mouth, and who came and went, who showed
himself here, there, and everywhere, and yet could never be
caught!</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;From elves, <i>hobs</i>, and fairies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Defend us, good Heaven,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>say Beaumont and Fletcher in one of their plays.&nbsp; And
every reader of Shakespear will remember how in &ldquo;A
Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; the Fairy addresses Puck
as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That shrewd and knavish
sprite<br />
Called Robin Goodfellow:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while by-and-by she adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those that Hob-goblin call you, and sweet
Puck,<br />
You do their worst, and they shall have good luck.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the extreme north of England the pet name for Robert was
Dob, or &ldquo;Dobbin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Curiously enough, to this day
the term for Hob-goblin is there &ldquo;Dobby.&rdquo; <a
name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; I ask the reader, if this can be
an accident?&nbsp; Could it have been possible that five distinct
names should be given to the <i>ignis fatuus</i>, or to such
woodland elves as were supposed to reveal themselves under his
frolicsome light, all having Robert as their chief component, had
not the thousand and one stories about Robin Hood and his merry
men and their nightly escapades been spread over the land by the
ballad-mongers of the time that immediately followed his
death?</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; Once more: look at our <i>general nomenclature</i>
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>of men,
birds, beasts, and shrubs.&nbsp; So common had &ldquo;Hob&rdquo;
become in the northern and midland districts (for every man you
might meet &rsquo;twixt York and Leicester was sure to be
&ldquo;Hob&rdquo;), that it became a cant term for a country
yokel.&nbsp; Thomas Fuller in his &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; speaks of
&ldquo;country-hobs&rdquo; where we should speak of
&ldquo;country-men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, too, Coriolanus is made to
say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why in this wool-less toge should I stand
here,<br />
To beg of Hob and Dick?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>jack-ass</i> is just as often called
&ldquo;<i>dobbin</i>&rdquo; in the north, and an ewe-lamb a
<i>hob</i>-lamb.&nbsp; The tame ruddock has become the
&ldquo;<i>robin</i> redbreast&rdquo;; a chicken, a <i>roblet</i>
(robelot, <i>i.e.</i>, little robin); bindweed goes by the title
of &ldquo;Robin-run in the hedge&rdquo;; the common club moss is
&ldquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;s hatband&rdquo;; while every child is
familiar with &ldquo;ragged robin,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;herb-robert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely this is enough to testify to the popularity of
Robert!&nbsp; The fact is, that Robin Hood gave a start to his
name similar in its effects to that of a snowball.&nbsp; He has
grasped all he has touched.&nbsp; He has left his memory upon
everything.&nbsp; He has stamped his march upon things animate
and inanimate.&nbsp; So long as we have a language and a
dictionary, a nomenclature, and a directory, we shall daily be
reading and looking upon words and names which, however
meaningless on the surface, are teeming with recollections of the
bold outlaw, whose thrilling adventures, whose kindly bounties,
whose supposed devotion to liberty, made him the idol of <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>his own time,
and an object of interest to his countrymen so long as England
shall endure.</p>
<p>And now we may ask, what has Robin Hood done for English
nomenclature, so far as surnames are concerned?&nbsp; Well, in
the first place, he made &ldquo;Robert&rdquo; the favourite name
at the font for a century at least.&nbsp; We even find Robin Hood
itself appearing as a surname.&nbsp; A tradesman bearing the
sobriquet of Thomas Robyn-Hod, lived at Winchelsea in 1388.&nbsp;
At the very time that Robert was thus popular, baptismal surnames
were being established.&nbsp; As a consequence, Robert was no
sooner a Christian name than it became a candidate for the place
of a surname.&nbsp; Remembering the different pet names in
familiar use, it will not be so astonishing that I should be able
to collect no fewer than forty-six separately-spelled surnames,
all descended from this one single appellation! while London
alone could gather into Hyde Park as many as five thousand souls
whose individuality is recognised by their associates through the
medium of this famous title.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; <i>Robert</i> has given us Robert, Roberts,
Robart, Robarts, Robertson, Roberson, and Roberton.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; <i>Robin</i> has bequeathed Robin, Robins,
Robbins, Roblin, Robinson, and Robison.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; <i>Rob</i> has left us Robb, Robbs, Robbie,
Robson Robkins, Ropkins, and Ropes.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; <i>Dob</i> has handed down to us Dobb, Dobbs,
Dobbie, Dobson, Dobbins, Dobbing, Dobinson, and Dobison.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>)&nbsp; <i>Hob</i> has transmitted Hobb, Hobbs,
Hobbes, Hobbiss, Hobson, Hobbins, Hoblyn, Hopkins, Hopkinson,
Hopps, and Hopson.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp; Besides these there were once such
familiar French diminutives as Robinet, Dobinet, Robel&ocirc;t,
and Robert&ocirc;t.&nbsp; These did not come directly from France
or Normandy.&nbsp; They were forms adopted by the country people
from the habit, common then as now, of copying the fashions of
the more noble families.&nbsp; Elizabeth Robinett will be found
in the London Directory.&nbsp; Hers is the only instance that I
can find still existing.&nbsp; The rest were all surnames in the
fourteenth century. <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p>(<i>g</i>)&nbsp; The Welsh, seizing upon the name, turned
ap-Robert and ap-Robyn into Probert and Probyn, respectively.</p>
<p>Can I add anything to prove the popularity of Robin
Hood?&nbsp; It is possible that we could not have spoken of
Hobbism, or of a Hobbist, for the founder of that system of
philosophy might have borne some other name.&nbsp; It is possible
that there might have been no &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s
choice,&rdquo; for that worthy liveryman at Cambridge might,
under some other sobriquet, have compelled the young collegian to
take the next horse on the list, or none.&nbsp; Certainly our old
friend <i>Punch</i> would have been unable to poke fun at
Cockneydom under at least one name of the famous company of
&ldquo;Brown, Jones, Smith, and <i>Robinson</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is possible, too, that &ldquo;before you could say Jack
Robinson&rdquo; would never have become an English
commonplace.&nbsp; How the phrase originated I cannot <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>say, but it
is a very old one, if the couplet quoted from an old play by Dr.
Halliwell be genuine:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A warke it ys as easie to be doone,<br />
As tys to saye &lsquo;Jacke Robyson.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

68</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EARLY PET NAMES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present and following chapter I
purpose devoting to the further consideration of the subject of
baptismal names.&nbsp; There are distinct epochs in the history
of names, as in the history of everything else.&nbsp; One great
crisis in our national nomenclature was the Norman
Conquest.&nbsp; With the exception of Alfred, Arthur, Edwin,
Edward, Ethel, and say a dozen other agnomens which were
preserved through various accidents, all English names of the
pre-Norman period disappeared before the end of the twelfth
century.&nbsp; They were literally submerged beneath the
advancing tide of Norman titles and usages.&nbsp; All the great
popular sobriquets so familiar to us to-day, such as William,
Henry, Ralph, Richard, Gerald, Robert, and even Scripture and
Saint&rsquo;s-day names like John, Ellis (Elias), Stephen, and
Matthew, belong to the later epoch.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>But an
equally grave crisis in English nomenclature was the publication
of an English Bible, and the Reformation of Religion that
followed.&nbsp; From that day all our common and familiar Bible
names came into use.&nbsp; Till then the only Scripture names in
vogue were those set down in the Calendar of the Saints, or such
names as were employed in the &ldquo;Mysteries,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Plays&rdquo; taken from Scripture stories, performed at
festivals for the amusement and instruction of the peasantry and
tradespeople.&nbsp; From the day of the Reformation the
<i>out-of-the-way</i> sobriquets of the Bible came into
favour.&nbsp; As these increased, what we may call the pagan
names decreased.&nbsp; The popularity of Harry, Dick, Robert, and
Walter began to fade.&nbsp; Some, like Hamond, Avice, Drew, Payn,
and Warin, altogether disappeared, while Guy, Baldwin, and Edward
held but a most precarious existence.</p>
<p>Here then are two epochs&mdash;the Norman, and the
Puritan.&nbsp; Let us confine ourselves in this chapter to the
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pagan</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Christian</i>&rdquo;
were both favourite baptismal names in the Norman epoch.&nbsp;
The former was registered as &ldquo;Payn&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Paine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chaucer says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The constable and Dame Hermigold, his
wife,<br />
Were payens, and that country everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All our &ldquo;Pagans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Payns,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Paines,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pinsons&rdquo; are from this
old-fashioned sobriquet.&nbsp; A century ago, the Hon. Thomas
Erskine having been seized with a serious illness, and kindly
tended at Lady Payne&rsquo;s house in London, wrote,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true I am ill; but I need not
complain,<br />
For he never knew pleasure who never knew Payne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Christian</i> has never been popular in England, but
Christopher has; and besides the long &ldquo;Christophers&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Christopherson,&rdquo; has left us Kitts and
Kitson.</p>
<p>Another name, a Scripture name too, is now all but wholly
disused&mdash;that of Samson.&nbsp; I daresay many of my readers
have thought that our many Sampsons are all but entirely
descended from Sam-son, <i>i.e.</i>, the son of Samuel.&nbsp; I
have no hesitation in claiming a full half for the son of Manoah,
the Danite.&nbsp; The old registers teem with entries like
&ldquo;Samson de Battisford&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sampson
Dernebrough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shallow says (2 <i>Hen. IV.</i>),
&ldquo;And the very same day did I fight with one Sampson
Stockfish, a fruiterer behind Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor
Colbrand,<br />
To mow &rsquo;em down before me,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says the porter&rsquo;s assistant in <i>Henry VIII</i>.&nbsp;
The fact is, the story of Samson was a favourite one with our
forefathers, and often performed at the miracle-plays.&nbsp;
There are nearly fifty Sampsons and Samsons in the London
Directory, some of them being of purely Jewish descent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Elegant Extracts,&rdquo; a favourite storehouse of good,
bad, and indifferent (very) poetry for the youth of our country
in the last century, has the following, anent this
name:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jack, eating rotten cheese, did say,<br />
&lsquo;Like Samson, I my thousands slay.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;I vow,&rsquo; quoth Roger, &lsquo;so you do,<br />
And with the self-same weapon too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Speaking of Roger, we may note that he is fast going out
of fashion.&nbsp; There was a day when &ldquo;Hodge&rdquo; was as
familiar as Hob, Dicon, or Harry.&nbsp; A single glance at our
Directory will prove this, for to him we owe all our Hodges,
Hodgsons, Hodgkins, Hodgkinsons, Hodsons, Hotchkiss&rsquo;s,
etc.&nbsp; Just as Hob, from Robert, became Dob in North England,
so Hodge, from Roger, became Dodge.&nbsp; From Dodge we get our
Dodgshons, and Dodgesons.&nbsp; Just as, also, Hodgson became
Hodson, so Dodgson has become Dodson.&nbsp; The Welsh turned
Ap-Roger into Prodger.&nbsp; All this proves a popularity for
Roger utterly beyond its present modest pretensions.</p>
<p>A great deal of nonsense has been written upon one of the
noblest family names in England&mdash;Howard.&nbsp; It is
constantly said, and as constantly reiterated, that the sobriquet
is one of occupation, being nothing more nor less than Hog-ward,
or hog-herd, corresponding to Swinnart from swine-herd, Coward
from cow-herd, Shepherd from sheep-herd, Calvert from calve-herd,
and Stoddart and Stottard from stot-herd (<i>i.e.</i>, stot,
bullock).&nbsp; All these latter are without doubt what they seem
to be, for old registers give them in their more manifest
dress.&nbsp; But Howard is only another form of Harvard, or
Hereward, or Heoruvard.&nbsp; Thus we find such an early entry as
John Fitz-howard (that is, John, the son of Howard), clearly a
baptismal surname.&nbsp; When Byron wished to hurl an invective
at the head of his relative, the Earl of Carlisle, he quoted
Pope,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What can ennoble knaves, or <i>fools</i>,
or cowards?<br />
Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
italics are Byron&rsquo;s, and every one knows the family name of
the Lords of Carlisle.&nbsp; As a quotation, it was apt; as
applicable to the Earl, it was the opposite; but Byron in a rage
meant Byron ungovernable either by courtesy or truth.&nbsp;
However, my point is, that the ancestral house of the Howards are
not descended from a hog-herd,&mdash;though it would be no
disgrace if they were, for a shepherd once became a king and a
poet,&mdash;but from one of those grand personal names which
existed in England before the Norman Conquest was dreamt
of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hereward, the Saxon&rdquo; has been made
familiar within the last few years by Charles Kingsley.&nbsp;
This is but the same name in an earlier dress.&nbsp; It might
have been considered a happy thought, if the author had dedicated
his book to one of the Howards, and stereotyped their
identity.</p>
<p>In my work on &ldquo;English Surnames&rdquo; I have given a
somewhat exhaustive list of the various appellations formed from
English baptismal names.&nbsp; So I will merely hint at a few and
pass on.&nbsp; Walter, as Wat, gave us Watkins, Watts, Watson,
and Watkinson.&nbsp; The old familiar form for Walter was Water,
which explains Shakespear&rsquo;s play upon the name in <i>Henry
VI.</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My name is Walter Whitmore.<br />
How now! why start&rsquo;st thou?&nbsp; What, doth death
affright?</p>
<p><i>Suffolk</i>.&nbsp; Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is
death.<br />
A cunning man did calculate my birth,<br />
And told me that by <i>water</i> I should die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Waters and Watersons are thus explained.&nbsp; <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span><i>Antony</i>
has bequeathed us Tonkin, Tonson, and Tounson; <i>Philip</i>,
Phipps, Phillips, and Philpotts (<i>i.e.</i> Philipot, that is,
little Philip, a pet name).&nbsp; A curious form of Philpot may
be seen in the Directory in the shape of Fillpot.&nbsp; This
reminds us that many a play has been made on the name.&nbsp; It
was not so very long ago that Punch facetiously remarked upon the
fact that the newly elected Bishop of Worcester was Philpott, the
then Bishop of Exeter being the celebrated Philpotts,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good appointment?&nbsp; No,
it&rsquo;s not,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said old beer-drinking Peter Watts;<br />
&lsquo;At Worcester one but hears &ldquo;Philpott,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At generous Exeter
&ldquo;Philpotts.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A large number of patronymics are to be seen in the surnames
that come under the division &ldquo;N&rdquo; in the
Directory.&nbsp; In the old song &ldquo;Joan to the
Maypole&rdquo; it is said,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nan,
Noll, Kate, Moll,<br />
Brave lasses, have lads to attend &rsquo;em:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hodge, Nick, Tom, Dick,<br />
Brave country dancers, who can amend &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nan&rdquo; stands for Anna or Hannah, Noll for Olive or
Oliver, in this case Olive, a girl&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; In fact,
every name that began with a vowel was turned into a pet form
beginning with &ldquo;N.&rdquo;&nbsp; Edward became Ned, and Emma
Nem.&nbsp; Thus in St. Peter&rsquo;s, Cornhill, the register
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sept. 20, 1577.&nbsp; Fryday, buryed, Nem
Carye, daughter of Harry Carye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humphrey became Nump, and Abel, N&#257;b.&nbsp; In <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alchemist,&rdquo; the tobacco man Abel
addresses Face,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I have another thing I would
impart,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to which Face replies,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Out with it, N&#257;b.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Isabella became Nib.&nbsp; The result of this is, that
such surnames as Nibbs, Nabbs, and Nemms or Neams, are
common.&nbsp; Even Nance, which figures twice in the Postal
Directory, is just as likely to be the old &ldquo;Nans,&rdquo;
from Anna, as from the town of Nantes.&nbsp; The owner can take
his choice, however, and probably will prefer the local
origin.</p>
<p>Talking of girls&rsquo; names, we may notice how many surnames
owe their origin to Matilda, Emma, Isabella, and
Petronilla.&nbsp; There are pages of Tillotsons, Tillots,
Tilletts, Tilts, and Tills, all from the old pet form Till.&nbsp;
Emma, too, is commemorated in little companies of Emms, Emps,
Emsons, Empsons, Emmotts, Emmetts, and Emmotsons; while Isabella
is not far behind with the retinue of Ibbs, Nibbs, Ibbotts,
Ibbetts, and Ibbotsons.&nbsp; Petronilla, the feminine form of
Peter, was always known as Parnel, and is thus found in St.
Peter&rsquo;s, Cornhill:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1586, Aprill 17.&nbsp; Sonday, christening
of Parnell, daughter of William Averell, merchaunt
tailor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence our many Parnells and Parnalls.&nbsp; Mary has left us
Mollison and Marriott (<i>i.e.</i> little Mary), but was never
popular in England during the days of surname formation.&nbsp;
Maria was practically unknown till the seventeenth century.&nbsp;
As Charles Lamb says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;<i>Maria</i> asks a statelier pace,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ave, Maria, full of grace!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Romish rites before me rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Image worship, sacrifice,<br />
And well-meant but mistaken pieties.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a proof that even in days long anterior to the
Reformation the English peasantry had an inrooted objection to a
foreign religious yoke, in the shape of Popery, that such names
as Peter and Mary should be so scantily represented.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true that Peter has left his mark upon the
Directory.&nbsp; There are shoals of Peters, Petersons, Perkins,
Pearces, Piers, Pierces, and Pearsons, but their origin belongs
to an earlier day.&nbsp; Certain it is, that at least a century
before the reign of Mary, the name was growing into disrepute
with the English people, and no doubt the obnoxious tax of
Peter&rsquo;s-pence was at the root of it.</p>
<p><i>Guy</i> was turned in Norman nurseries into Guiot
(<i>i.e.</i>, little Guy); this in English was transformed into
Wyatt.&nbsp; How popular this name was four hundred years ago, is
proved by the fact that there are nearly sixty Wyatts set down in
the London Directory alone.&nbsp; William, Walter, Warin, and
Wyatt all testify to the change of French G into English W.&nbsp;
In the French Directories they will still be found as Guillaume,
Gualter, Guarin, and Guiot.&nbsp; And as Guillaume became
William, so Guillemot (little William) became Williamot, and then
Wilmot.&nbsp; The French, however, unlike the English, were very
fond of adding <i>two</i> diminutives to the name.&nbsp; Thus,
Guillot (little Will) became Guillotin (little wee Will).&nbsp;
This reminds us of Dr. Guillotin, who invented that terrible <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>instrument
which played such a horrible part in the French Revolution.&nbsp;
In the same way, Hugh (always spelt &ldquo;Hew&rdquo; in
medi&aelig;val records) became English Hewet (little Hugh), and
French Hugot.&nbsp; But our neighbours, inserting another
diminutive, turned it into Hugenot (little wee Hugh).&nbsp; This
at once explains a matter of much contention.&nbsp; There has
been much strife as to the origin of the word Huguenot.&nbsp; Had
our friends only been aware of the fondness of the French some
centuries ago for <i>double diminutives</i>, they would have seen
at once that the sect sprang from some <i>individual</i> bearing
that name, the origin of which is perfectly simple.&nbsp; It may
be of interest to add, that we in England have never used
<i>double diminutives</i>.&nbsp; In France it was the rule rather
than the exception, as their Directories fully prove.&nbsp;
Introduced by the Normans, we have both &ldquo;in&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ot&rdquo; or &ldquo;et,&rdquo; as in
&ldquo;Col<i>in</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hew<i>et</i>,&rdquo; from
Nicholas and Hugh; but we never conjoin them to one name.&nbsp; A
Frenchman four hundred years ago would have turned them into
&ldquo;Col-in-et,&rdquo; &ldquo;Col-ot-in,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hugu-in-ot,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hug-ot-in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true, we in England called children
&ldquo;Rob-in-et,&rdquo; as I have shown in a previous chapter;
but it was a mere passing fancy.&nbsp; I was wrong, however, in
stating that the surname &ldquo;Robinet&rdquo; is practically
obsolete, for Mr. Hutton, the Rector of Stilton, writes to inform
me that in a village adjacent there are several families of this
name.</p>
<p>Thomas owed its great popularity to Thomas &agrave; Becket,
who for a time at least was a popular idol.&nbsp; Few baptismal
names have laid their impress on <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the London Directory as this has
done.&nbsp; Rows of Thomas&rsquo;s appear, many hailing from the
Welsh border.&nbsp; These are flanked by columns of Thompsons
with a &ldquo;p,&rdquo; and Thomsons without a
&ldquo;p.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dancing attendance on these more important
members of the Thomas family, are scattered up and down a few
Thomassets, and Thomsetts, memorials of the old pet name
&ldquo;Thomaset&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> little Thomas).&nbsp; But
Thomas seemed to imagine that the &ldquo;h&rdquo; in his side
ought to be got rid of, so he appears in shoals as Tompkins, with
a &ldquo;p&rdquo; again, and again as Tomkins without a
&ldquo;p.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor relations do not like to make their
connection too prominent, for fear of giving offence, so in the
background, but close enough to be ready to make good their
claim, appear several Toms, Thoms, Tomes, and Tombs.&nbsp; This
last looks very funereal indeed, and would seem to be a local
name taken from one who has had his dwelling amid the tombs, but
&ldquo;b&rdquo; was often put at the end in that way.&nbsp; Thus
Timbs is from Tims, that is, Timothy.&nbsp; A string of Tomlins
and Tomlinsons completes the list.&nbsp; Many will remember the
rhyme about Thomas the footman, whom his lady married:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear lady, think it no reproach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It showed a generous mind,<br />
To take poor Thomas in the coach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who rode <i>before behind</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lady, think it no reproach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It show&rsquo;d you loved the more,<br />
To take poor Thomas in the coach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who rode <i>behind before</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a fair number of Guns, Gunns, and <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Gunsons, in
our Directory.&nbsp; There is a slang phrase about being the
&ldquo;son of a gun.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a common occurrence in
old days when such entries as &ldquo;Richard filius Gunne&rdquo;
were frequently made.&nbsp; The fact is, &ldquo;Gun&rdquo; was a
baptismal name, and the surnames mentioned above are but sprung
from it.&nbsp; It is not many years since Mr. Gunson preached the
assize sermon at Cambridge before Mr. Baron Alderson and Mr.
Justice Patteson.&nbsp; The following rhyme got
abroad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Baron, a Justice, a Preacher,&mdash;sons
three:<br />
The Preacher, the son of a Gun is he;<br />
The Baron, he is the son of a tree;<br />
Whose son is the Justice I can&rsquo;t well see,<br />
But read him <i>Pater</i>son, and all will agree<br />
That the son of his father the Justice must be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alderson is but a form of Aldrichson, Aldrich being once a
common baptismal name; while Patterson, Paterson, Pattison, and
Patteson, are all commemorative of Patrick, who, strange to say,
was scarcely remembered at the font at all in Ireland at a time
when he was very popular in England.</p>
<p>Every country has a sobriquet which stands as a kind of
baptismal name for the nation, as distinct from the
individual.&nbsp; England is represented by John, or John Bull;
Scotland by Alexander, as Sawney or Sandy; Ireland by Patrick, as
Pat; and Wales by David, in the dress of Taffy.&nbsp; Let us
trace their origin very briefly, and see their effect upon our
nomenclature.&nbsp; In 1385 the Guild of St. George, at Norwich,
contained 376 names; of these 128 were John!&nbsp; This
extraordinary proportion was the direct <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>result of the
Crusades.&nbsp; From the Jordan, in which Christ had been
baptized, every crusader brought home in his bottle water for
baptismal purposes.&nbsp; He could not christen his child by the
name of Jesus, the Baptized&mdash;this would be blasphemy; but he
could give it the name of the baptizer, John.&nbsp; Remember,
too, that John the Baptist was &ldquo;Elias.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence
Baptist, John, Ellis, and Jordan, became the favourite baptismal
names for several generations.&nbsp; Our Jordans, Jordansons,
Jordsons, Judds, Judsons, and Judkins are all memorials of this,
for Judd did not become the pet name of George till the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; In early days it was the nickname of
Jordan.&nbsp; The other day I saw a register of a child
christened &ldquo;River,&rdquo; his surname being Jordan.&nbsp;
Thus both names have the same origin.&nbsp; This kind of thing is
common.&nbsp; I know registers where may be seen three
&ldquo;River Jordans.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Windsor Castle&rdquo;
occurs in a Derbyshire church record.&nbsp; But John took the
lead.</p>
<p>One of the most curious freaks in the history of nomenclature
is that which made Jack the nickname for
&ldquo;John.&rdquo;&nbsp; The French for James was Jaques
(Jacobus).&nbsp; This being the then favourite name in France,
got popularized in England, with this difference, that the common
folk took it and made it the pet name of their own favourite name
&ldquo;John.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus our Jacks, Jacksons, Jacklins, are
all reminiscences of John rather than James.&nbsp; It is so
still.&nbsp; No one ever dreams of styling a boy called James,
Jack.&nbsp; To this day, John and Jack are synonymous.&nbsp; The
Flemings brought in &ldquo;Hans&rdquo; (<i>i.e.
Johannes</i>).&nbsp; These have originated our Hankins,
Hankinsons, Hancocks, <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Handcocks, Hanks, and Hands.&nbsp;
Further distinction was obtained by nicknaming some boys as
&ldquo;Little-John,&rdquo; &ldquo;Proper-John&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i>, handsome: in country parts, they still say of a
young man, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a proper young fellow&rdquo;).&nbsp;
The French introduced Gros-Jean (Big-John) and Bon-Jean
(Good-John), and the latter got corrupted into Bunyan.&nbsp; To
John we owe our Johnsons, Jones, Jennings, Jenkinsons, Jenkins,
and Jenks.&nbsp; No doubt, when Mr. Jenkins wrote
&ldquo;Ginx&rsquo;s Baby,&rdquo; he was aware that both author
and hero bore the same name, for &ldquo;Ginx&rdquo; is simply
&ldquo;Jinks&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jenks&rdquo; caricatured.</p>
<p>Miss Yonge thinks that Margaret Atheling introduced Alexander
into Scotland from the Hungarian Court.&nbsp; Her third son was
Alexander, and under him and the other two Alexanders Scotia was
prosperous.&nbsp; Hence its great popularity.&nbsp; Sawney and
Sandy are the pet forms, and the surnames Alister, McAlister in
the Highlands, and Sanders or Saunders in the Lowlands, will for
ever prevent the name being forgotten.</p>
<p>Patrick, the patron saint of Irishmen, whose festival is kept
wherever Irishmen may be, has, strange to say, left scarcely a
single surname.&nbsp; There is &ldquo;Kil-patrick,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gos-patrick&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, servant of Patrick
(Gos = gossoon, <i>i.e.</i> gar&ccedil;on), but no real
patronymic.&nbsp; How is this?&nbsp; One single reason will
suffice.&nbsp; At the time of surname formation
&ldquo;Patrick&rdquo; was scarcely ever used at the font.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Teague&rdquo; was the popular name till the end of the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; Under 150 years ago, Englishmen spoke
of an Irishman, not as &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; but as
&ldquo;Teague.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could prove this equally from
registers and ballads.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;Taffy,&rdquo; of course, was and is the Welsh
national name, and owes his origin to St. David, who lived in the
sixth century, and through his sanctity caused his bishop&rsquo;s
see to be changed from Menevia into St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Davy, Davis, and Davies are therefore common enough in the
Principality.&nbsp; From our childhood we have heard
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Taffy was a Welshman,<br />
Taffy was a thief;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but we trust, for the credit of our friends across the Severn,
that this refers to a particular Taffy, and not to the national
Taffy.&nbsp; Black sheep are to be found in every flock.&nbsp;
That Taffy can be a hero, Happy Dodd and his compatriots can
prove; and never was the Albert Medal more richly deserved or
more bravely won, than on the morning that witnessed the rescue
of the imprisoned miners in the Welsh coal-pit.&nbsp; All honour
to Taffy!</p>

82</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BIBLE AND NOMENCLATURE.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">said</span> in my last chapter that I
should devote the present one to a relation of the causes that
led to a complete revolution in our English baptismal
nomenclature in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&nbsp;
During this comparatively brief period, most of the popular
medi&aelig;val names lapsed, not merely from favour, but into
total oblivion.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, this does not properly
appertain to the subject of surnames, because, having now become
an established system, it was impossible for the Reformation to
affect them to any appreciable extent.&nbsp; That is, the
Reformation could revolutionize our baptismal names, but not our
surnames.&nbsp; Had the Reformation occurred three or even two
centuries earlier, the London Directory of 1877 would have
presented a totally different appearance to that which <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>it
does.&nbsp; Instead of half a thousand Harrisons and Harrises, we
should have had, may be, a hundred &ldquo;Calebsons,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Abnersons,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joshuasons,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jaelsons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because surnames were
undergoing their hereditary formation then.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our subject is quite apropos to the Directory,
for Christian names abound there as well as surnames.&nbsp; If
the pages of that great tome do not show that our surnames were
visibly affected by an open Bible, a Reformation of Religion, and
a Puritan Commonwealth, it is not so with the baptismal
names.&nbsp; Every page bears strong evidence of a wondrous and
stirring revolution.</p>
<p>Let us first clear the ground.&nbsp; In what relation did the
Bible stand to English nomenclature in pre-Reformation
days?&nbsp; The Scripture names in use during that period were
fourfold in origin.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; <i>Names so prominent in Scripture</i> that
none could be ignorant of them, such as Adam and Eve.&nbsp; All
our Atkins, Atkinsons, Adams, Adamsons, Adkins, Adkinsons, and
Addisons come from Adam; all our Eves, Evisons, Evetts, Evitts,
Evotts, and Evesons, from Eve.&nbsp; An old will, dated 1391,
speaks of the same individual as Eve and Evot (<i>i.e.</i> little
Eve).&nbsp; Adam and Eve, four hundred years ago, were two of our
commonest personal names.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; <i>Names of Bible heroes</i>, whose story was
wont to be dramatized on religious festivals, and thus made
familiar to the peasantry.&nbsp; The offering of Isaac, and
Daniel in the den of lions, were two favourite plays.&nbsp; Thus,
Isaac as Higg or Hick, and Daniel as Dan, were popular
everywhere.&nbsp; Thus we got as surnames, <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Higgins
(<i>i.e.</i> little Isaac), Higginson, Hicks, Hickson, Higgott
and Higgs, from the one, and Daniels, Danson, Dankins, Dannett
(<i>i.e.</i> little Daniel), and Dann from the other.&nbsp;
Higgonet,&mdash;a double diminutive (treated of in our last
chapter),&mdash;became Hignett; and even non-smokers must have
seen the virtues of Hignett&rsquo;s &ldquo;mixture&rdquo;
glowingly described in the daily advertisements!&nbsp; Imagine
Higgins or Hignett as derived from Isaac!&nbsp; Nevertheless,
such is the undoubted fact.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; <i>Ecclesiastic names</i>, or names taken
from the calendar of the saints, such as Bartholomew, Nicholas,
or Peter.&nbsp; The reader would be indeed amazed if I were to
furnish him with a list of all the surnames founded upon these
three once familiar names.&nbsp; Bate, Bartle, and Bartelot were
the pet forms of Bartholomew, whence our Bates, Battys, Batsons,
Bartles, and Bartletts.&nbsp; St. Nicholas gave us Nicholls and
Nicholson, Nix, Nicks, Nixon, and Nickson.&nbsp; Cole (whence our
Coles) was the most favoured pet form, however, of Nicholas; and
this, with the popular Norman-French diminutives
&ldquo;<i>in</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>et</i>&rdquo; appended,
made Colin and Colet.&nbsp; Hence our many Collins, Collinsons,
Colsons, Colletts and Colets, not to mention the double
diminutive Colinet.&nbsp; As for Peter, I have already reminded
the reader of the pages of names that the London Directory
contains, all originated by that agnomen upon which Rome has
founded her most pretentious and arrogant claims.&nbsp; When we
reflect that previous to the incoming of the Normans there were
no Scripture names in use in England, saving in the case of a few
ecclesiastics, <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>who had adopted them at ordination, we can in some
little degree realize the great revolution our national
nomenclature had undergone in respect of the three classes I have
here summarised.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; <i>Festival names</i>, such as Christmas or
Pascal.&nbsp; The other day I was passing through a street in
Kensington, and saw &ldquo;Pentecost&rdquo; over a door.&nbsp; It
is a curious surname, and yet not uncommon.&nbsp; The reader
perhaps wonders how such a term got into our Directory.&nbsp; Its
origin is perfectly simple.&nbsp; Like John, or Thomas, it was
but a baptismal name, and having become so used, it inevitably
came to the honours of a surname.&nbsp; How? says a reader.&nbsp;
This way,&mdash;John, the son of Pentecost, five hundred years
ago, becomes John Pentecost, and the thing is done.&nbsp;
Pentecost is no exceptional instance.&nbsp; The London Directory
contains many a Christmas, or Midwinter, or Paschal, or Pask, or
Nowell, or Noel.&nbsp; All these medi&aelig;val terms for
religious seasons were used as baptismal names, (being given to
children born on these festivals,) and then became
surnames.&nbsp; The Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel got his surname in
such a manner.&nbsp; Noel was quite a familiar term in England
and France for Christmas Day; and a child born on that eventful
morn would naturally receive as his font-name that which gave
title to the day, especially when we consider that Noel is
nothing more than &ldquo;Natalis,&rdquo; the &ldquo;natal
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; As time passed on, and the meaning of Noel
became obscure, the Christmas waits pronounced it &ldquo;Now
well!&nbsp; Now well;&rdquo; as they sang their midnight
carol.&nbsp; It was a pretty and significant mistake.&nbsp;
Surely, as Noel <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>comes round, many a believer can catch the strain of
angelic &ldquo;glad tidings&rdquo; of a Saviour born, and say,
&ldquo;Now well, indeed, for me and all mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nowell&rdquo; is the commonest form of the surname.&nbsp;
In France, all children born on Easter Day were christened
&ldquo;Pascal.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, becoming a surname, was handed
down to Blaise Pascal, one of the most brilliant and most pious
men that that great country has ever produced.&nbsp; In the north
of England Easter was always known as &ldquo;Pace,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Pask.&rdquo;&nbsp; These of course are common
surnames.&nbsp; &ldquo;To go a pace-egging&rdquo; is still a
familiar phrase in Lancashire and Yorkshire; and the prettily
ornamented eggs are still sold in the shops as Easter comes
round.&nbsp; By a happy conceit, they are often called
&ldquo;Peace-eggs&rdquo;; and certainly &ldquo;Pace&rdquo; has
proved &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; to myriads of souls.&nbsp; The
Registrar-General, in one of his reports, came across a Christmas
Day&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the child&rsquo;s surname being
&ldquo;Day,&rdquo; the parents had it christened
&ldquo;Christmas.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pentecost,&rdquo; for a
child born on Whit-Sunday, was once extremely popular. <a
name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a></p>
<p>But these quaint customs have come to an end.&nbsp; To baptize
an infant by the name of &ldquo;Pentecost&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Paschal&rdquo; would now be considered a piece of
eccentricity, not to say irreverence.&nbsp; The Reformed Church
of England has sufficiently emphasized these festivals in her
Services, without laying too great stress upon them.&nbsp; The
superstitions and follies that gave over-prominence to such
seasons in medi&aelig;val days ceased with an open English Bible
and a purer <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>and simpler Christianity.&nbsp; The danger now is a rush
to the other end of the tether.&nbsp; I believe there are
thousands of living Nonconformists who regret that they have
allowed such services as would have commemorated the events of
Easter Day, Good Friday, and Ascension Day to fall into
desuetude.&nbsp; The neglect of Ascension Day, even among
Churchmen, is, I think, much to be deplored.</p>
<p>But if the Reformation threw one class of names into the cold
shadow of neglect and oblivion, it took care to fill up the gap
with an assortment of its own selection.&nbsp; We may set down
the interval between 1580 and 1720 as the most curious era in the
history of personal names, whether of this or any other
country.&nbsp; The more I have studied our English baptismal
registers of the seventeenth century,&mdash;and I may say,
without boasting, few have studied them more frequently than
I,&mdash;the more profoundly am I convinced that no other
revolution of a religious or social character in the annals of
nations can present claims to eccentricity equal to that which,
beginning with the Reformation, found its climax in the Puritan
Commonwealth.&nbsp; Alas! I can only touch upon the subject here,
but I could easily fill a book with instances gleaned by myself
in a not very long life.&nbsp; Friends interested in the same
pursuit, I must add, have also helped me; not to mention <i>Notes
and Queries</i>, that storehouse of treasures to antiquaries of
every bent.</p>
<p>The first signs of serious change betrayed themselves at the
beginning of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; The English Bible
rested in English hands.&nbsp; But it <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>was a new book.&nbsp; Names familiar
enough in 1877, but probably heard of for the first time in 1577,
were drawn forth from their concealment, and made to subserve the
new impulse of the nation.&nbsp; It was then that the minister at
the font had to begin registering such names as &ldquo;Abacucke
Harman,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sydrach Sympson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Phenenna
Salmon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gamaliel Capell,&rdquo; &ldquo;Archelaus
Gifford,&rdquo; &ldquo;Melchizedek Payne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dyna
Bocher,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zebulon Clerke.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was as
if the Bible were a new country full of verdant tracks, and as
they passed through each plucked the flower that pleased him
most.&nbsp; By the time King James came to the throne,
&ldquo;Phineas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Philemon,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uriah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aquila,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Priscilla,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hilkiah&rdquo; had become the
rage.&nbsp; Before he died, Harry had fallen into neglect, Ralph
and Guy were utterly despised, and names like Hamlet, or Hamnet
(Shakespear&rsquo;s son was Hamnet), or Avice, or Douce, or
Warin, or Drew, or Fulke, had gone down like sodden logs in a
stagnant pool.&nbsp; Whether they will ever come into use again
is very doubtful.&nbsp; Only national caprice can do it; but
that, we know, can do anything.&nbsp; That Avice, so pretty and
simple as it is, should have disappeared, I cannot but think a
national loss.</p>
<p>By the time of Charles the First, the national taste had gone
a degree further.&nbsp; It becomes positively amusing to study
the registers of this period.&nbsp; It had evidently become a
point of respectability among certain classes of the community to
select for their children the rarest names of Scripture.&nbsp;
John, Nicholas, Bartholomew, Thomas, and Peter, <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>though
Scriptural, were tabooed; a stain rested on them, as having been
in the Calendar during centuries of popish superstition.&nbsp; In
fact, the Apostles were turned out for having kept bad
company.&nbsp; Many seemed to have rested their claim to thorough
knowledge of the Bible upon the rarity of the name they had
discovered in its pages.&nbsp; Thus I find &ldquo;Ebedmeleck
Gastrell,&rdquo; whose Christian name only occurs once in the
Scriptures (Jer. xxxviii. 8).&nbsp; &ldquo;Epaphroditus
Houghton,&rdquo; &ldquo;Othniell Haggat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Apphia
Scott,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tryphena Gode,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bezaliel
Peachie,&rdquo; are cases in point.&nbsp; If a child were styled
by a new, quaint, unheard-of title, as a matter of course it was
assumed to be from the Bible.&nbsp; From the appearance of such a
name as &ldquo;Michellaliell,&rdquo; I fancy tricks of this kind
were common.</p>
<p>A further stage of eccentricity was reached when it became
fashionable to emphasize the doctrine of original sin by affixing
to the new-born child a Scripture name of ill-repute.&nbsp; The
reader can have no conception how far this was carried.&nbsp; In
the street Dinahs and Absaloms walked hand-in-hand to school;
Ananiases and Sapphiras grovelled in the dirty courts and alleys;
and Cains took Abels to pluck flowers in the rural lanes and
meadows, without thoughts of fratricide.&nbsp; Archbishop
Leighton, son of a much persecuted Presbyterian minister, had a
sister Sapphira.&nbsp; The acme of eccentricity was reached in
the case of <i>Milcom</i> Groat, whose Christian (!) name was
&ldquo;The abomination of the children of Ammon.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
may be seen in the State Papers (Domestic).&nbsp; I am furnishing
all these names hap-hazard from my notebooks.&nbsp; <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>In the
dame&rsquo;s school the twelve patriarchs could all have answered
to their names through their little red-cheeked representatives
who lined the wall, unless, maybe, Simeon or Reuben stood on a
separate seat with the dunce&rsquo;s cap on!&nbsp; But the
strangest freak of all is still to be recorded.&nbsp; We have all
heard of Praise-God Barebones.&nbsp; Hume, in his History of
England, asserts that his brother bore the long name of
&ldquo;If-Christ-had-not-died-for-thee-thou-hadst-been-condemned
Barebones.&rdquo;&nbsp; What the historian adds to this I will
not repeat, for fear of seeming irreverent.&nbsp; Many have
supposed this to have been a case of mere exceptional
eccentricity.&nbsp; Nothing of the kind.&nbsp; It was not an
uncommon custom for a man or woman after conversion to reject
with horror the pagan name of &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; which their god-parents had imposed upon
them, and be known henceforth as &ldquo;Replenish,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Increase,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Abstinence,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Live-well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, if they married after
this, they spared their children the necessity of any such
alteration by furnishing them with personal appellations of this
character at the outset.</p>
<p>The earliest specimens of this peculiar spirit will be found
in the reign of Elizabeth&mdash;that is, within a score of years
or so of the Reformation and the gift of an open English Bible;
so we must not suppose it was wholly an institution of what we
may term the Cromwellian period.&nbsp; It reached its climax
then, nothing more.&nbsp; In the Elizabethan &ldquo;Proceedings
in Chancery&rdquo; may be seen such names as Virtue Hunt,
Temperance Dowlande,&mdash;Temperance was one of our <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>most popular
names for a hundred and fifty years,&mdash;Charitie Bowes, and
Lamentation Chapman.&nbsp; Lamentation would easily be affixed to
a child whose mother had died in childbirth.&nbsp; Ichabod has
often been given for a like reason.&nbsp; On the contrary,
&ldquo;Comfort&rdquo; would be readily seized upon under
circumstances of Christian or parental joy.&nbsp; The other day I
was in Tewkesbury Abbey, now undergoing restoration, and, as is
my wont, I began ferreting for peculiar names.&nbsp; In a
churchyard I instinctively walk like a dog with my nose to the
ground.&nbsp; Almost immediately, I came across two
&ldquo;Comforts,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Comfort, wife of Abram
Farren, died Aug. 24th, 1720,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Comfort Pearce,
died Nov. 17th, 1715;&rdquo; the latter was granddaughter of the
former.&nbsp; Miss Holt, whose &ldquo;Mistress Margery&rdquo; and
other sound and thoroughly well-written stories will have been
read by most of my readers, told me not long ago that she had
seen in the register of St. James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly, the
following entries:&mdash;&ldquo;Repentance Tompson,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Loving Bell,&rdquo; &ldquo;Obedience Clark,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Unity Thornton&rdquo;; &ldquo;Nazareth Rudde,&rdquo; also,
was contained in the same record.&nbsp; This reminds me of
&ldquo;Jerrico Segrave&rdquo; in a Derbyshire record.&nbsp; In
that county it was very possible for Bible place-names to be thus
incorporated into personal nomenclature.&nbsp; Among the ruder
peasantry it was a common custom,&mdash;a custom dating from the
Reformation,&mdash;to have their child baptized by the first name
the eye lighted on after the parent had let the family Bible fall
open upon the table.&nbsp; A clergyman not long ago, asking in
the Baptismal Service &ldquo;What name?&rdquo; received the
whispered rejoinder, <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>&ldquo;Ramoth Gilead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Naturally enough, he inquired, <i>sotto voce</i>, &ldquo;A boy or
a girl?&rdquo;&nbsp; A curious instance of this general class is
to be found in the case of Frewen, Archbishop of York, who died
in 1664.&nbsp; He was son of a Puritan minister in Sussex; his
Christian name was &ldquo;Accepted,&rdquo; and his younger
brother was &ldquo;Thankfull.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is from this epoch
that we must date the origin of some of our prettiest, if not now
most popular, names for girls: &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; &ldquo;Charity,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prudence.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these
have survived the era in which they, and a hundred longer and
less simple terms, were introduced; and if they are now getting
out of favour, it is only one more proof that the fashions in
detail, as well as the fashions generally, of this world, undergo
silent, it may be, but inevitable change.</p>
<p>We must not suppose, however, that there was no spirit of
antagonism to this remarkable practice, so new in origin, and yet
so deeply established.&nbsp; I have carefully avoided any
reference to the disagreements that led to the execution of
Charles the First, and the Commonwealth.&nbsp; If this era was
socially vicious, it was also religiously hypocritical.&nbsp;
Both sides had good and bad men in their midst.&nbsp; A poem
written in 1660, styled a &ldquo;Psalm of Mercy,&rdquo; is an
evident &ldquo;skit&rdquo; by some Royalist upon the new taste in
nomenclature.&nbsp; It is too long for quotation, and though not
actually ribald, is better left in its obscurity.&nbsp; It pokes
fun at the following names:&mdash;Rachel, Abigaile, Faith,
Charity, Pru (Prudence), Ruth, Temperance, Grace, Bathsheba,
Clemence, Jude, Pris (Priscilla), Aquila, Mercy, Thank, Dorcas,
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Chloe,
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; It is curious to note, that while none of
these names could be found in an English register prior to 1560,
in 1660, when this satirical ballad was indited, there was not
one which was not more or less popular, not one of which I myself
have not found several instances in contemporary records.&nbsp;
We have only to add, that after the recital of all these names,
the poet concludes with a couplet which we cannot insert here,
but which indicates very clearly that the writer was not very
much drawn to this new phase of feeling.&nbsp; However, if we are
to thank the Roundheads for the introduction of many really
pretty names,&mdash;names, too, awakening sweet Biblical and
religious associations in our hearts,&mdash;we must not forget
that it was owing to the antagonistic spirit of the Cavaliers
that we are still in possession of not a few old names, which,
though pagan in origin, are rendered dear by their antiquity and
their relations to English life and character generations ere the
Reformation was dreamt of.&nbsp; Above all, we must never forget,
that whether the name be in the Bible or out of it, whether it be
given at the font or even in the registrar&rsquo;s office, it is
the man that sanctifies the name, not the name the man.&nbsp; It
was not their names that made Venn, and Simeon, and Wilberforce
venerated; but Venn, and Simeon, and Wilberforce, by their
earnest devotion and stable piety, made themselves so revered by
Christian Englishmen that their names are still uttered with that
hushed and bated breath that is the deepest demonstration of
regard that human heart can express.&nbsp; Let us not then
regret, that if by one band of men the treasury <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>house of the
Scriptures was ransacked for a new vocabulary of nomenclature, to
another band we owe the preservation from the death they were
threatened with, of Ralph, Walter, Dick, Harry, Cecilia, Lucy,
Beatrice, Julia, Robert, Humphry, and Edward.&nbsp; Again do you
say, &ldquo;But they are pagan!&rdquo;&nbsp; Prythee, friend,
will you say that because Latimer bore the pagan name of Hugh, he
died &ldquo;without hope,&rdquo; as a dog dieth; or that she who
permitted his body to be burned, because she bore the name of
Mary, could assert with her nominal prototype that &ldquo;All
generations shall call me blessed&rdquo;?&nbsp; Her name is
written in blood; and &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo; she will be
styled from English lips, till the Reformation be branded as a
mistake, and its heroes as fools.</p>
<p>I have laid stress,&mdash;nay, I have dwelt
lingeringly,&mdash;on these now quaint and old-mannered names for
a particular reason.&nbsp; How many of my readers there must be
who, without realizing the causes, are conscious of the fact that
the Christian names of our cousins across the Atlantic, and those
of ourselves, are marked by a certain divergence.&nbsp; When the
Pilgrim Fathers set forth from Plymouth and Bristol, they bore
with them their Puritan cognomens; and there, in Virginia and all
the east border of the great States, they are established nearly
as firmly to-day as they were in England two hundred years
ago.&nbsp; Take up an American story, and in the names of its
heroines you can tell, not only their nationality, but the
writer&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Grace&rdquo; are still their favourite titles.&nbsp; Nor
is this a mere accident.&nbsp; If we turn to Mr. Hottens&rsquo;
list <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>of
emigrants between 1600 and 1700, we find such names to have been
of everyday occurrence.&nbsp; In the same family we find such
trios as &ldquo;Love Brewster,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear
Brewster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Patience Brewster&rdquo; quitting our
shores.&nbsp; We find a brother and sister registered as
&ldquo;Hopestill Foster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Patience Foster;&rdquo;
while such entries as &ldquo;Perseverance Green,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Desire Minter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Revolt Vincent,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Joye Spark,&rdquo; &ldquo;Remember Allerton,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Remembrance Tibbott&rdquo; greet one at every turn.&nbsp;
In such titles as these&mdash;&ldquo;Hope-still,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; &ldquo;Remembrance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Desire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Perseverance&rdquo;&mdash;our minds are inevitably thrown
back to those days of religious persecution, while we seem to be
bidding these travellers God-speed on their distant and uncertain
journey from the pierhead as the good ship lifts her anchor; and
we can detect in the heart of the emigrant that mingled tide of
hope and fear, trust and regret, confidence in the future united
with a fond and lingering looking back, which still abides
unbanished,&mdash;in spite of occasional tall talk,&mdash;from
the American&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; He is proud of his land, but he
does not forget the old country.&nbsp; No man so proud of making
a name for himself as he; and yet no man so proud of tracing his
pedigree back to a name that has been already made for him
generations ago on England&rsquo;s soil!&nbsp; In the twofold
title of &ldquo;Hopestill&rdquo; and &ldquo;Remembrance&rdquo;
still lives all that speaks of reverence in America&rsquo;s past
and expectation for America&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>If it were necessary, we could easily show how the same thing
has happened to the vocabularies of the two countries that has
befallen the two nomenclatures.&nbsp; <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>We smile when a Yankee says, &ldquo;I
guess,&rdquo; &ldquo;I calculate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I
reckon;&rdquo; but when we read in the Epistle of St. Paul the
sentence &ldquo;<i>I reckon</i> that the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
shall be revealed in us,&rdquo; do we always reflect, as we might
do, that our translators and revisers of 1611 were simply putting
into the mouth of the apostle a phrase which was then colloquial
English, but now survives, in all its familiarity, only in the
United States, whither the Puritan Fathers had carried it?&nbsp;
This comparison we might easily extend, but it is not our
subject.</p>
<p>As for American baptismal nomenclature in general, it is all
but entirely Biblical.&nbsp; The only book the refugee took with
him was his English Bible.&nbsp; His piety was fed from its
pages, his life was likened to its histories, his surroundings
had the same cast of primeval simplicity; he discovered a
resemblance between his own new life and that of the patriarchs,
and it pleased him to stereotype the resemblance by the adoption
of their names.&nbsp; From out that Book alone he named his
offspring, and thus to this day,&mdash;such is the power of
tradition,&mdash;&ldquo;Brother Jonathan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uncle
Sam&rdquo; are but representatives of a class of names which
well-nigh engrosses every other.&nbsp; A single instance will
suffice to show how this great mass of Biblical nomenclature
arose.&nbsp; Charles Chauncy died in New England, 1671.&nbsp; He
emigrated from Hertfordshire, where the family had been settled
for centuries.&nbsp; His children were Isaac, Ichabod, Sarah,
Barnabas, Elnathan, Nathaniel, and Israel.&nbsp; All these grew
up and settled in New England.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>It has
been well said, that were it not for our English Bible the two
languages of the United States and England would slowly but
surely separate themselves into two distinct dialects, possibly
tongues.&nbsp; Certainly it is to that book which
Wycliffe,&mdash;whom we commemorated in 1877,&mdash;wrote into
English, we owe the fact that in no respect is there a closer
bond and deeper sympathy betwixt England and America than in that
which concerns the nomenclature of the two countries.&nbsp; In
what respect they differ I have shown.&nbsp; While <i>we</i> have
dropped some names that marked eccentricity, and restored some of
the older and more pagan cognomens from the oblivion that seemed
so certainly to await them, <i>they</i> have clung tenaciously to
that more quaint and large class of names of Scriptural origin,
which their forefathers of Puritan stock bore with them across
the ocean in days when America was as yet a portion of the
British dominions.</p>
<p>May the twofold offspring of one stock hold fast still, as in
days of yore, to that One Name in the Bible which is above every
name!&nbsp; Then shall the two great branches of the Anglo-Norman
race continue to multiply and be strong, and all the continents
of the world shall be blessed through their means.</p>

98</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OFFICERSHIP.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">set</span> out with the intention of
writing six chapters on the &ldquo;London Directory;&rdquo; and,
lo! I have reached the mystic seven.&nbsp; The worst of it is,
that at the present rate of progress I shall have to transgress
the editorial licence by at least four more before I can possibly
bring my remarks to a close, consistent with the demands of my
subject.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Editor has only to say the word,
and I will wipe,&mdash;not my tearful eye, but my goose quill,
and bid my courteous reader adieu!</p>
<p>The other day I met a friend, and he greeted me with the
remark, &ldquo;Awfully dry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thinking he referred to
the weather&mdash;it was the end of June&mdash;and feeling
decidedly warm, I assented cordially, when I discovered that the
statement was intended to be a less polite than concise criticism
upon one or two of my later instalments to <i>The Fireside</i>,
on the subject <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>that heads these pages.&nbsp; My friend made several
other remarks founded on the first, and went so far as to offer
me some advice&mdash;a very dangerous thing, as everybody
knows.&nbsp; It was to this effect: &ldquo;Stick to your
text.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is my text?&nbsp; I asked, thinking to
take him off his guard.&nbsp; &ldquo;The London Directory,&rdquo;
he replied promptly.</p>
<p>Well, I must admit that in the last two papers I slightly
wandered from my text.&nbsp; My excuse is this: baptismal names
are in the London Directory as well as surnames; and the
baptismal names of to-day are as different from the baptismal
names of five hundred years ago as were the baptismal names of
five hundred years ago from those in vogue five hundred years
before that.&nbsp; This curious fact I wished to bring out and
develop.&nbsp; At the same time I wanted to show that it was the
English Bible that had caused the change.&nbsp; Whether I
succeeded in so doing, I must leave to the reader to
decide.&nbsp; At any rate, I can now turn, with such cheerfulness
as my stern critic has left me, to the next class of English
Surnames represented in the London Directory&mdash;that
originated by Office, whether ecclesiastical or civil.&nbsp; I
have got the Directory itself at my left elbow, not merely as a
monitor to warn me, but also as a reference to support me.&nbsp;
Looking to this mighty tome, then, for inspiration as well as
illustration, I at once begin.</p>
<p>The Directory teems with relics of the feudal system.&nbsp;
There is not a single office belonging to that formal and
ceremonious age which is not commemorated within its pages.&nbsp;
Whether it were service <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>within the baronial hall or tenure
without, all was held by a retinue who thought no office too mean
or servile for acceptance.&nbsp; The feudatory, in fact, could
seemingly do nothing; everything was done for him.&nbsp; He could
eat and drink, &rsquo;tis true, and he did both to the great
admiration of all beholders; but he had an officer to carve his
meat for him; another to change his plate; a third to crack jokes
for him, to aid his digestion; a fourth to extend a bowl to wash
his fingers; a fifth to hand him a napkin to wipe them; a sixth
to hold his wine-cup for him; and a seventh to taste each fresh
dish set before him, so that in case poison had been put in the
food, his taster might drop down dead instead of himself.&nbsp;
Why the baron hadn&rsquo;t an officer to wipe his nose for him, I
can&rsquo;t say; it has always been a mystery to me.&nbsp; One
thing, however, is certain.&nbsp; As he sat and ate and drank, he
had a little crowd of officers who thought it only too high a
distinction to perform duties so menial, that a scullion in the
present day, if asked to undertake some of them, would probably
reply, &ldquo;Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this
thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; At any rate, he would give you a
month&rsquo;s notice, to a certainty.</p>
<p>That all these officerships existed, the Directory still
shows; for I have no hesitation in saying that the finest and
most trustworthy records of the feudal age are to be found, not
in the British Museum in Great Russell Street, nor the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, but in that great red-backed tome which lies
on the shelf in every London warehouse.&nbsp; Imagine our going
to these dry and prosaic emporiums of <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>merchandise for an account of a long
past state of life, which, with all its barbarism, is well-nigh
the most poetical era of English history.&nbsp; I mentioned seven
officers who tended the baron at his meals.&nbsp; Taking the
Directory, I find twelve Carvers, two Sewers, eleven Napiers and
Nappers, six Ewers, one hundred and twenty-five Pages, not to
mention our various &ldquo;Cuppages&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
Cup-page), Smallpages, and Littlepages, six &ldquo;Says,&rdquo;
and twenty-four &ldquo;Sayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true there
are no &ldquo;Fools&rdquo; in the Directory, though there may be
plenty out of it; but once it was a very common name indeed, and
denoted the <i>officer</i>, if I may use the term, whose duty it
was to convulse the table with laughter by making the most
ludicrous jokes he could invent, backing them up with all sorts
of grimaces and contortions.&nbsp; He was a professed punster,
too, and had free licence to make them at the expense even of his
lord.&nbsp; Indeed, the fool could make a joke with impunity,
which would have cost any other man his head.&nbsp; Of course he
wore a fool&rsquo;s-cap as the insignia of his office.&nbsp; The
Napier, or Napper, set the napkins, once called
&ldquo;napes.&rdquo;&nbsp; A curious and silly story has got
abroad, that the Scotch Napiers got their surname from one
Donald, whose prowess was so great in a certain battle, that the
king said he had &ldquo;na peer,&rdquo; that is, no equal.&nbsp;
His friends,&mdash;so the tale goes,&mdash;from henceforth styled
him Donald Na-pier.&nbsp; The Scotch Napiers are, as Mr. Lower
shows, of the house of Lennox, and owed their cognomen to the
office I have described, held by their ancestors in the royal
household.&nbsp; The Ewer carried the ewer of water in <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>front of
the Napier; and as they had no forks in those days, and used
their left hand in a manner which would be now considered the
reverse of polite, no wonder that between every course the
<i>napier</i> and <i>ewer</i> would be busy indeed.&nbsp; Even
the carver had no fork, and had to use his fingers very freely
with the joints.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Boke of Kervynge,&rdquo; an
old manual of etiquette for young squires, there is a strict
order to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Sett never on fyshe, flesche,
beest, nor fowle, more than two fyngers and a
thumbe&rdquo;!&nbsp; The young squire had early to learn this
accomplishment; and therefore Chaucer, describing his Squire,
made a point of saying in his favour,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Courteous he was, lowly and servisable,<br
/>
And carf before his fader at the table.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sewer brought in the viands; we still use the root in such
compounds as <i>en-sue</i> and <i>pur-sue</i>.&nbsp; A
<i>sewe</i> was any cooked dish or course of meat.&nbsp; Hence
Chaucer, describing the rich feasts of Cambuscan, says, time
would fail him to tell&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of their strange sewes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s household still boasts, I believe, its six
Gentlemen Sewers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Page,&rdquo; of course, was a
familiar spectacle, for he was here, there, and everywhere, at
the beck and call of his lord.&nbsp; No wonder, therefore, he has
so many representatives in our Directory.&nbsp; It is said that
an elderly bachelor, bearing this name, became deeply attached to
a young lady.&nbsp; Being bashful by nature, and unacquainted
with the arts of courtship, he hung about the damsel <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>for a long
time, seeking vainly for courage and opportunity to declare the
state of his mind.&nbsp; The golden chance came at last.&nbsp; At
a party one night the fair lady dropped her glove.&nbsp; He
rushed to pick it up, and presenting it to her, said,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If from that glove you take the letter
&lsquo;G,&rsquo;<br />
Then glove is love, and that I give to thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She at once responded,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you from Page should take the letter
&lsquo;P,&rsquo;<br />
Then Page is age,&mdash;and that won&rsquo;t do for
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe he was taken ill and went home.</p>
<p>Knight, like Squire and Bachelor,&mdash;all relics of feudal
days,&mdash;is largely represented in London.&nbsp; A would-be
reader of the poets, it is said, went into a shop and asked to
see a copy of &ldquo;Young Knight&rsquo;s Thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was somewhat astonished to find that &ldquo;Young&rdquo; was
not an adjective, but a surname.&nbsp; This reminds one of
Southey&rsquo;s story of the lady who, seeing a book advertised
bearing the title &ldquo;An Essay on Burns,&rdquo; ordered a
copy, thinking it treated of scalds, and might contain some
remedies.&nbsp; Say, Sayer, Guster, and Taster&mdash;the last
alone being now obsolete&mdash;all refer to the office mentioned
above; the duty of the first bearers of these several names being
to hazard their own lives for the preservation of their
masters&rsquo;.&nbsp; In a word, they stood behind their
lord&rsquo;s chair, and as every dish of meat or cup of wine was
brought in, they <i>assayed</i> it (<i>i.e.</i>, they took the
first bite or sup); so that if either had been
&ldquo;drugged&rdquo; by some conspirator in the kitchen, the
baron might escape.&nbsp; It is right to add, to prevent
misconception, <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>that in some cases our Sayers owe their origin, like
&ldquo;Tester,&rdquo; to another officership&mdash;that of
examining money, to see whether it was full weight and of genuine
metal.&nbsp; There are four or five &ldquo;Testers&rdquo; in the
London Directory.</p>
<p>We may close this list with the mention of such surnames as
Spencer or &ldquo;Spenser&rdquo;; Marshall, Chamberlain or
Chamberlin, Warder, and Butler.&nbsp; All these represented
important officerships.</p>
<p>We may here take the opportunity of referring to the condition
of the lower classes.&nbsp; In the country there was no middle
class, such as we know by the term, excepting those who are
represented in the Directory under the sobriquet of Yeoman,
Yeomans, and Yeomanson.&nbsp; The peasantry were oftentimes
little more than goods and chattels of their masters.&nbsp; We
must not exaggerate, however, for although there are sixty-four
&ldquo;Bonds&rdquo; in the London Directory, who represent such
old entries as &ldquo;William le Bonde,&rdquo; the progenitors of
this name were in no such abject servitude as is now understood
by the word.&nbsp; That they were hard worked there can be no
doubt:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of alle men in londe<br />
Most toileth the bonde,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and how much freedom was valued may be guessed from the number
of Franks, Franklins, Frees, Freebodys, Freemans, Freeds, and
Freeborns, in the big tome we are discussing.&nbsp; We find even
Free-wife and Free-woman in the older registers, but they are now
obsolete&mdash;in the Directory, I mean, not in actual life, for
very often the wife not merely &ldquo;rules her house,&rdquo; <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>but her
husband too, and a good thing for him if he only knew it!&nbsp;
There are fifty-three &ldquo;Frys&rdquo; to be added to this
list, the old form of &ldquo;free.&rdquo;&nbsp; How curious that
the lady who so distinguished herself in toiling for the
abolition of slavery should have borne the name of Elizabeth
Fry!&nbsp; Who strove more earnestly to make the bond free than
she?&nbsp; Truly Tom Hood meant jest for earnest when he wrote
his ode to Dr. Kitchener:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What baron, or squire, or knight of the
shire<br />
Lives half so well as a holy Fry-er?<br />
In doing well thou must be reckoned<br />
The first&mdash;and Mrs. Fry the second.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he says in jest and rhyme, with a sly hit in the last
line at her Quaker garments:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I like you, Mrs. Fry!&nbsp; I like your
name!<br />
It speaks the very warmth you feel in pressing<br />
In daily act round Charity&rsquo;s great flame&mdash;<br />
I like the crisp Browne way you have of dressing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Hood had known the meaning of Mrs. Fry&rsquo;s name, he
could have made a better play than this upon it.&nbsp; The forms
in the old rolls are Walter le Frie, or Roger le Frye.</p>
<p>The country police were represented by various terms, and as I
turn the page of my book of modern reference I am reminded of
them all.&nbsp; The Hayward guarded the fences; the Forester or
Forster or Foster, the Woodward, the Parker, the Warrener or
Warner, the Woodreeve, now found as Woodruff or Woodroff, all
protected the covers wherein the beasts of the chase found
harbourage.&nbsp; The Pinder, or <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Pounder, was engaged in locking up
strayed cattle.&nbsp; Every village had its pound, and no doubt
in a day when hedges and dikes and fences were less familiar
sights than now, his office would be an important one.</p>
<p>It may be asked, Have we any relic in our Directories of any
office in the large towns answering to our modern policeman, or
&ldquo;peeler,&rdquo; as our street <i>gamins</i> so
disrespectfully style him?&nbsp; We answer in the
affirmative.&nbsp; Our somewhat common surname of Catchpoll,
Catchpole, Catchpool, and Catchpoole are his
representatives.&nbsp; They were so called because, as they
walked their beat, they carried a somewhat formidable weapon,
very like a pitchfork, the two prongs of which slipped round the
neck, and formed a steel collar.&nbsp; The officer then had the
criminal entirely at his mercy, and could either drag him, or
shove him by the pole attached, which was from six to seven feet,
in length.&nbsp; He was called a Catchpoll, because he
<i>caught</i> his victim by the head or <i>poll</i>.&nbsp; We
still talk of a poll-tax, or &ldquo;going to the poll,&rdquo;
showing how familiar the word was in those days.&nbsp; The
Malvern Dreamer, in his poem entitled &ldquo;The Vision of Piers
Plowman,&rdquo; says of the two thieves crucified with our
Saviour, that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A cachepol cam forth,<br />
And cracked both their legges.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another form, Catcherell, lingered on for a time in our
nomenclature, but it is now gone, unless Cattrall be but a
corruption.&nbsp; An old sermon of the fourteenth century speaks
of the &ldquo;devil and his angels&rdquo; as the &ldquo;devil and
his cachereles&rdquo;!&nbsp; Our &ldquo;Waites&rdquo; and <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;Waits&rdquo; represent the night watchmen.&nbsp;
As they both sounded the watches and gave the alarm with a
trumpet or horn, it came to pass that any band of night
serenaders acquired the name.&nbsp; We are all familiar with the
Christmas &ldquo;waits&rdquo;!&nbsp; I see there are two
&ldquo;Wakemans&rdquo; in the Directory.&nbsp; The wakeman was
the North English form of &ldquo;watchman,&rdquo; just as kirk is
North English for church, or dike for ditch, or thack for
thatch.&nbsp; Thus, Wycliffe translates Mark xii. 37,
&ldquo;Forsooth, that that I say to you, I say to all, Wake
ye,&rdquo; where our modern translators have
&ldquo;Watch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strangely enough, in Psalm cxxvii. 1
they have employed both forms.&nbsp; &ldquo;The watchman waketh
but in vain,&rdquo; should have been either &ldquo;The wakeman
waketh but in vain,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The watchman watcheth but in
vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it stands it is incongruous, for it gives
the modern reader the idea that the watchman had been asleep,
implying that he had been negligent, which, of course, is not in
the original.&nbsp; When we remember, as I have shown, that
&ldquo;wake&rdquo; and &ldquo;watch&rdquo; were but the same word
with two pronunciations, one North English and the other South
English, the difficulty is explained. <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; A north <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>countryman,
if he wants to say that his neighbour is a shrewd fellow, says,
&ldquo;Eh, but he&rsquo;s a wak&rsquo; un.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether a Lancashireman or a Yorkshireman is the
most &ldquo;wak&rsquo;;&rdquo; but an old saying gives the
preference to the County Palatine.&nbsp; If a Lancashireman wish
to be ahead of a Yorkshireman, it says, he must be up at two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning; but if a Yorkshireman wish to be
ahead of a Lancashireman, he mustn&rsquo;t go to bed at
all.&nbsp; We may surmise that a Lancashireman originated the
saying.&nbsp; Both &ldquo;Wake&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo; are
in the London Directory.&nbsp; Brook, in his &ldquo;History of
the Puritans,&rdquo; relates a story concerning these two
names.&nbsp; It seems, by a curious coincidence, that Isaac Wake
was University Orator at Oxford, in 1607, Dr. Sleep being a
well-known Cambridge preacher at the same time.&nbsp; James the
First, who not merely liked his joke, but was fond of listening
to sermons,&mdash;both characteristic of a Scotchman,&mdash;used
to say, &ldquo;he always felt <i>inclined</i> to Wake when he
heard Sleep, and to Sleep when he heard
Wake&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, he could not decide on the
relative merits of the two.&nbsp; Wake and Sleep will both be
nicknames&mdash;the ancestor of the one doubtless being a sharp
shrewd fellow; the progenitor of the other, I daresay, being
thought somewhat dull and stupid by his neighbours.</p>
<p>Speaking about &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wake&rdquo;
reminds us of a name which has been a puzzle to many&mdash;that
of &ldquo;Gotobed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last time I was in the
metropolis, I saw it over a door in Great Portland Street.&nbsp;
The name has acquired additional interest since Mr. Trollope
introduced it in one of his most able stories, <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>&ldquo;The
American Senator.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of our humorous poets had
already played upon it in the lines,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Barker&rsquo;s as mute as a fish in the
sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Miles never moves on a journey,<br />
Mr. Gotobed sits up till half after three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Makepeace was bred an attorney.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is just possible it is a nickname, for it occurs in
registers as Gotobedde since the days of Elizabeth.&nbsp;
Besides, there is a like nickname in the Hundred Rolls in the
case of &ldquo;Serl Gotokirk,&rdquo; a sobriquet given to the
owner on account of his regular and frequent attendance at
worship.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I believe it to be a baptismal
surname.&nbsp; I doubt not it is a mere corruption of Godbert,
once a favourite child&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; When I add that I find
it five hundred years ago entered as &ldquo;Godeberd,&rdquo; a
little later as &ldquo;Gotebedde,&rdquo; and more recently
&ldquo;Gotobedd,&rdquo; I think the question may be looked upon
as settled.</p>
<p>But I am falling into a snare.&nbsp; Methinks I hear my stern
critic saying, &ldquo;What has Gotobed to do with official
surnames?&mdash;stick, Sir, to your text.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, the
connection does certainly seem somewhat vague; but Wakeman was
official, and it led me to Wake, and from Wake it was not very
odd that I should pitch upon Sleep, and after all you can never
sleep comfortably unless you <i>go to bed</i>.&nbsp; Still, to
soothe my friend, I will hark back, and conclude this chapter by
a reference to a few ecclesiastic surnames.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true that Henry the Eighth and others demolished
our abbeys, monkeries&mdash;as Latimer styles
them&mdash;priories, and other Romish institutions that had
become objectionable to English morals.&nbsp; But one <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>thing they
could not do&mdash;uproot them from our registers.&nbsp; In the
London Directory, if nomenclature goes for anything, they never
flourished so vigorously as in the reign of Protestant
Victoria!&nbsp; Apart from Westminster Abbey, there are at least
five Abbeys in other quarters of the Metropolis, while no less
than seventy-three Abbots reside in the same neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Nor is this all.&nbsp; There are still left in London over fifty
&ldquo;Priors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pryers,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Pryors,&rdquo; over twenty &ldquo;Fryers,&rdquo; over
thirty &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; and nearly forty
&ldquo;Nunns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talk of the Papal aggression!&nbsp;
Why, Mr. Newdegate should call the attention of the House of
Commons, and through them that of the whole country, to the fact
immediately.&nbsp; It is awful to contemplate what is thus going
on under our very noses.&nbsp; It was only the other day that a
Nunn appeared in a small house out of the Strand <i>not more than
a day old</i>, if the register of births be correct.&nbsp; Talk
of boy-bishops, this is simply intolerable!</p>
<p>It is almost as bad when we turn to names that are less
Romishly suggestive.&nbsp; How can it be consistent with his more
orthodox duties, for an Archdeacon to be a furniture-broker, a
Dean to be a rag and bottle merchant, or a Bishop to be a tobacco
and snuff manufacturer!&nbsp; If my stern critic doubts my word,
I can only refer him to the London Directory.&nbsp; There, sir,
I&rsquo;m sticking to my text this time, surely!&nbsp; I know a
&ldquo;Priest,&rdquo; too, who keeps a chandler&rsquo;s shop
Marylebone way, and a &ldquo;Deacon&rdquo; who employs his
leisure hours in the delightful occupation of chimney-sweeping;
he resides in the vicinity of Edgeware Road.&nbsp; Not that I
blame them; for what better can <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>you expect from either Priests or
Deacons, so long as Bishops, Deans, and Archdeacons are guilty of
such vagaries as I have stated?</p>
<p>There was a time,&mdash;now a long while ago,&mdash;when two
personages contended for the honours of the Papal chair.&nbsp;
There are no less than thirty-six Popes in London at this present
moment; one is a greengrocer, by the way.&nbsp; I have not heard
of their quarrelling; and so far, at least, this must be
considered satisfactory.&nbsp; A good deal of blood was shed over
the rival claims of the first two.&nbsp; When James the First
came on a visit to Sir Thomas Pope, near Oxford, the
Knight&rsquo;s little daughter was introduced to his Majesty with
these lines,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See! this little mistress here<br />
Did never sit in Peter&rsquo;s chair,<br />
Neither a triple crown did wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet she is a Pope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No benefice she ever sold,<br />
Nor did dispense with sin for gold;<br />
She hardly is a fortnight old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet she is a Pope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A female Pope, you&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;a second
Joan?&rsquo;<br />
No, sure, she is Pope <i>Innocent</i>, or none.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An epigram, or a bit of wit, always pleased James the First,
who was no mean punster himself; and no doubt this little
entertainment at the entrance of the knight&rsquo;s mansion
helped materially to make his Majesty enjoy the hospitalities
lavished upon him within.</p>
<p>One name I have never yet seen in the London Directory, which
occurs in the old parliamentary <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>writs&mdash;that of &ldquo;Hugh
Holy-water-clerk.&rdquo;&nbsp; He dwelt at Lincoln, and was
doubtless connected with the cathedral body.&nbsp; But the old
&ldquo;Paternoster&rdquo; still exists hale and hearty, as
anybody may see who will take the trouble to inspect the big book
of reference which gives title to my pages.&nbsp; How many
thousands there are who daily pass Paternoster Row, and never
reflect that it derived its name from the fact that several
tradesmen who strung beads dwelt there.&nbsp; They were called
&ldquo;Paternosters,&rdquo; and found ample occupation and
profit, no doubt, in selling their religious ware to the people
as they entered the old cathedral to patter aves.&nbsp; That they
bore this name Mr. Riley has shown in his &ldquo;Memorials of
London,&rdquo; wherein not merely is &ldquo;William le
Paternoster&rdquo; mentioned as dwelling there, but a Robert
Ornel is described as following the trade of
&ldquo;paternoster.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a history there is conveyed
in such a registered name as &ldquo;Sarah Paternoster,
fishmonger, 336, Hackney Road&rdquo;!&nbsp; For centuries, as the
name has passed on from one generation to another, there has been
handed down with it a memorial of a time which can never
return,&mdash;at least, I believe it can never return,&mdash;a
time when our more superstitious forefathers and foremothers
thought they could win the favour of Heaven and the grace of God
by a glib and unmeaning reiteration of a prayer carefully and
solemnly framed by Christ Himself to express and comprehend all
the needs of the human heart.&nbsp; It is neither the length of
our prayers nor the number of our invocations that will save
us.&nbsp; It is the peculiarity of the Gospel narrative, that
those who received benefit at Christ&rsquo;s hands were they who
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>uttered
very short prayers; but then they knew what were asking for, and
from whom they were making request.&nbsp; Why, if grace depended
on the <i>quantity</i> of prayer, then we could reduce the
holiness of believers to a mere arithmetical ratio, and by the
amount of their petitions demonstrate to so many fractions how
much more saintly one Christian was than another.</p>
<p>But I had better stop, or my reader will think I am preaching
a sermon.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t my stern critic come down heavily
on me then?&nbsp; And I should not know what to say in
self-defence!</p>
<h2><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EMPLOYMENTS OF OUR
FOREFATHERS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> would be easier than to
occupy a half-dozen chapters with a relation of the mode in which
our forefathers led their lives.&nbsp; It is one peculiarity of
nomenclature, that it reaches into every nook and crevice of
English customs.&nbsp; What our ancestors specially favoured in
the way of meat and drink, is set down with the utmost
particularity in the London Directory of to-day, while, on the
other hand, it is by the absence of certain names therein that we
can form a safe judgment of what delicacies they lacked.&nbsp; No
one would expect to see the potato commemorated in the Directory,
for the simple reason that it was introduced into England after
surnames had become established on a solid basis.&nbsp; There are
no &ldquo;Tatermans&rdquo; or &ldquo;Taterers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
such names as Appletree, Appleyard, Plumtree, Pearman, and
Peascod, exist.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because apples, pears, plums,
and peas, <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>have been familiar to Englishmen for a dozen
centuries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Photographer&rdquo; is not in the
Directory for the same reason, but &ldquo;Limner&rdquo; is, the
old &ldquo;illuminator.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cabman&rdquo; is also
conspicuous by its absence, but &ldquo;Carman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Wagner&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Wagoner) exist.&nbsp; Had tea,
or umbrellas, or broughams, or balloons, or carpets, or potatoes,
or croquet balls, or telegraph wires, or tinned meats, or steam
engines, or churchwarden pipes, or Indian pickles, been
introduced about five hundred years ago, every one of these would
have left its mark on our personal nomenclature.&nbsp; Each would
have found itself commemorated in our directories as well as our
dictionaries.&nbsp; It is true the railway engine might seem to
have been referred to in such fourteenth-century registrations as
Richard le Engineur or William le Genour, but these men only
wielded the great battering-rams, or catapults, or engines for
hurling stones.&nbsp; Very destructive they were, of course, and
so important a profession that no wonder there are thirteen
&ldquo;Jenners&rdquo; in the London Directory alone.&nbsp; Sir
William Jenner can satisfy himself with the reflection that if
his progenitor was distinguished for the number of
England&rsquo;s adversaries he placed <i>hors de combat</i>, he
and his father have been equally remarkable for the number of
lives they have saved.</p>
<p>Let us spend a few moments in a consideration of this great
matter of eating and drinking.&nbsp; And we will begin with
drinking first.&nbsp; It is curious how easily misled we might be
by the corruptions that have taken place in our
nomenclature.&nbsp; The following surnames are in the London
Directory (1870): Brandy, <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Sherry, Gin, Port, Beer, Porter,
Stout, Claret, Portwine, Tee, and Coffee.&nbsp; Not one of these
is what it seems to be.&nbsp; Not one of these has anything to do
with the beverage each severally represents.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Portwine&rdquo; is a mere modernisation of
&ldquo;Potewyne,&rdquo; which in the fourteenth century denoted
the Poict tevine settler in England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Claret&rdquo;
was the pet name of &ldquo;Clare.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stout&rdquo; is of the nickname class,
&ldquo;Porter&rdquo; occupative, and &ldquo;Port&rdquo; is found
originally as &ldquo;Charles le Port,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oliver le
Port,&rdquo; showing that it was a sobriquet having reference to
the portly bearing of the progenitor.&nbsp; Tennyson speaks
of</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A
modern gentleman<br />
Of stateliest port.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the same with &ldquo;Aleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has no
connection with the public-house, but like &ldquo;Almaine&rdquo;
and &ldquo;D&rsquo;Almaine&rdquo; represents the old German
trader.&nbsp; The word was once in most familiar use.&nbsp;
Coverdale&rsquo;s exposition of the twenty-fifth Psalm has on the
title page, &ldquo;Translated out of hye Almayne (High Dutch) in
to Englyshe, by Myles Coverdale, 1537.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one will
require me to prove that James Tee and Peter Coffee do not
represent our modern and favoured national breakfast
beverages.&nbsp; At least the first, if he did, must have sprung
from some &ldquo;heathen Chinee,&rdquo; who has immigrated to our
shores.&nbsp; Such an elucidation, however, would neither satisfy
myself, my reader, nor James Tee himself, I imagine.</p>
<p>But we have quite sufficient relics of the drinking
propensities of the English people in bygone days without seeking
for them in their corrupted forms.&nbsp; <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>&ldquo;Inman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taverner&rdquo; both
represent the old keeper of houses of entertainment.&nbsp;
<i>Tavern</i> is going out of fashion: <i>Public-house</i> is a
modern term.&nbsp; Porson, the great Greek scholar, was unhappily
given to drink; but drunk or sober he had ever a Greek or Latin
quotation at the tip of his tongue.&nbsp; Reeling in the streets
of Cambridge, he one day tumbled down a flight of steps into a
cellar-tavern.&nbsp; As they picked him up, he was heard to
mutter,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Facilis est descensus t-averni.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Church of England temperance lecturers could not take a
better text than this clever pun; for, unlike most puns, it
contains a most admonitory truth.&nbsp; An old tavern-sign in
Cheshire, in the last century, bore the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Good <i>bear</i> sold here, our own
<i>bruin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This in the days of bear-baiting, for which Cheshire was
famous, would be very misleading to those of the country bumpkins
who could read.&nbsp; Brewer and Brewster need no
explanation.&nbsp; Malter and Malster both exist, but I do not
see them in the London Directory.&nbsp; There is Malthouse,
however, and that is sometimes found as &ldquo;Malthus&rdquo;;
just as loft-house, and kirk-house, and bake-house or back-house
have become Loftus, Kirkus, and Bacchus.&nbsp; Viner and Vinter
also stand in no fear of being misunderstood; but Tunman, Tonman,
Tunner, and Tonner, who casked and bottled the wine that came
from the Continent, would be less likely to be recognised.&nbsp;
In the &ldquo;Confessio Amantis&rdquo; it is said of Jupiter that
he</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Hath in his cellar, as men say,<br />
Two <i>town&egrave;s</i> full of love-drink,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where we must not suppose that the Thunderer had so capacious
a cellar that it would contain all the liquor that two whole
towns might possess, but that he had two <i>tuns</i> or barrels
of love potions.&nbsp; In fact, &ldquo;tun&rdquo; was the
universal term in use then, though <i>barrel</i> or <i>cask</i>
has superseded it in common parlance.&nbsp; We still talk of
&ldquo;tunnels&rdquo; or &ldquo;tun-dishes,&rdquo; the vessels
used for transferring wine from barrel to bottle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Beer-brewer&rdquo; was once a familiar surname, but it has
become obsolete.&nbsp; We all remember the old couplet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hops, Reformation, baize, and beer,<br />
Came into England all in one year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make the bitter taste, wormwood had been the chief
ingredient in earlier days.</p>
<p>While on this subject, it is worth while inquiring whether or
no we possess in our directories any record of the drinking
propensities of our forefathers.&nbsp; That they were ever great
&ldquo;skinkers&rdquo; everybody knows who has studied the past
with any degree of care.&nbsp; What the Water-poet said somewhat
coarsely of one may well be said of the many:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Untill hee falls asleepe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He skinks and drinkes;<br />
And then like to a bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He winkes and stinkes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the &ldquo;Friar,&rdquo; according to Chaucer,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;strong
was as a champioun,<br />
And knew wel the tavernes in every toun,<br />
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>And
every hosteler and gay tapstere,<br />
Better than a lazar or a beggere.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of these acknowledged facts, however, I am happy to
say there is not a single &ldquo;Drunkard&rdquo; in the London
Directory.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in our older registers the tale is
not so assuring.&nbsp; There has been a tendency during the last
two hundred years to shuffle off certain objectionable names,
which our earlier forefathers did not seem to be ashamed
of.&nbsp; Who of my readers would like to have been officially
registered as &ldquo;Maurice Druncard,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jakes
Drynk-ale,&rdquo; or worse still, &ldquo;Geoffrey
Dringke-dregges&rdquo;?&nbsp; Who of my readers would like to
sign himself in a marriage record as &ldquo;Robert le Sot,&rdquo;
or as &ldquo;Thomas Sour-ale&rdquo;?&nbsp; Even &ldquo;John
Swete-ale&rdquo; would scarcely have relished the sobriquet if he
had lived in this more punctilious age of ours.&nbsp; Where could
the young lady be found who would forego the charms of
spinsterhood to be wedded to an &ldquo;Arnold
Scutel-mouth&rdquo;&mdash;(what a capacious mouth it must have
been!)&nbsp; &ldquo;Alice Gude-ale-house&rdquo; may have been a
thoroughly honest and respectable landlady, but I don&rsquo;t
think she would have said &ldquo;no,&rdquo; if some smart and
worthy younker had offered her the refusal of his name.</p>
<p>Every one of these entries I have myself copied from authentic
registers.&nbsp; Curious, and yet not curious, is it that not one
of them has survived.&nbsp; So far as the Directory shows, we are
the soberest and most temperate nation on the face of the
earth.&nbsp; Thus do we throw a mantle over our great national
vice.&nbsp; Even when we cannot get rid of the fact, we manage to
smooth it over with a sesquipedalian gloss.&nbsp; <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>A woman in
the middle and higher ranks never gets drunk now-a-days.&nbsp;
She is a suffering martyr to dipsomania!&nbsp; How thankful we
should be for a Bible that says &ldquo;Be not drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who was the first English teetotaler?&nbsp; If we could find
him, I suspect our temperance friends would erect a monument to
him.&nbsp; There are seven &ldquo;Drinkwaters&rdquo; in the
Metropolitan register; and I am glad to say that Camden&rsquo;s
statement is wrong&mdash;it was only a guess&mdash;that
Drinkwater is a corruption of &ldquo;Derwentwater.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the first place it is an impossible corruption; for the
corruptive changes that pass over words and names are not
accidental, but follow fixed rules, so to say.&nbsp; In the
second place, I have been able to discover the name in its
present guise up to the very time when hereditary surnames were
established.&nbsp; &ldquo;John Drinkwater&rdquo; occurs in the
Hundred Rolls, and &ldquo;Richard Drynkwatere&rdquo; in the
Parliamentary Writs. <a name="citation120"></a><a
href="#footnote120" class="citation">[120]</a>&nbsp; No wonder
their posterity has survived, no wonder their name endures, for
they can boast that in their sobriquet lies the record of the
first English temperance movement.&nbsp; In a word, Mr.
Drinkwater number one must have been the forerunner of total
abstinence.&nbsp; None of his neighbours could have pointed to
him as a man who habitually, or occasionally upon days of
festival, &ldquo;got tight&rdquo;; his name, whereby they had
nicknamed him, was in itself a safeguard.&nbsp; His very title
pledged him to the principles it professed.&nbsp; No, he never
&ldquo;got tight,&rdquo; or if he did, like a good sailing craft,
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>he was
<i>watertight</i>.&nbsp; Some day I hope there will be a monument
erected to &ldquo;Drinkwater Number One.&rdquo;&nbsp; It might be
in the shape of a drinking fountain.&nbsp; What a heap of people
there are buried in state in Westminster Abbey who ought to give
place to &ldquo;Drinkwater Number One&rdquo;!&nbsp; But, alas! we
don&rsquo;t all get our deserts.</p>
<p>But enough of this.&nbsp; We have reminiscences in our
directories of meat as well as drink.&nbsp; Chaucer, speaking of
the &ldquo;Franklein,&rdquo; says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Withoute bake mete never was his house,<br
/>
Of fish, and flesh, and that so plenteous,<br />
It snow&egrave;d in his hous of mete and drink,<br />
Of all&egrave; deinti&egrave;s that men coud thinke.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Wo was his cook, but if his sauc&egrave; were<br />
Poignant and sharpe, and redy all his gear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This short and piquant description is important because of the
language used.&nbsp; We still use the word flesh in the
alliterative phrase, &ldquo;fish, flesh, and fowl;&rdquo; but we
should never ask for a &ldquo;pound of flesh&rdquo; in a
butcher&rsquo;s shop now, any more than we should talk of the
importation of &ldquo;American flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should say
&ldquo;meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The distinction, however, is preserved
in this account, and we are reminded that before the Norman
&ldquo;Butcher&rdquo; or &ldquo;Boucher,&rdquo; and French
&ldquo;<i>Labouchere</i>&rdquo; came in, the seller of flesh-meat
was called a &ldquo;Fleshmonger&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Flesher.&rdquo;&nbsp; So late as 1528, William
Fleshmonger, D.C.L., was Dean of Chichester.&nbsp; I fear the
name is now obsolete.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;Fleshers&rdquo; still
exist, but most of them have become absorbed in
&ldquo;Fletcher,&rdquo; which represented the trade <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of
feathering arrows: we still employ the word
&ldquo;fledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bowyers and Fletchers and
Arrowsmiths always marched abreast in the old trades&rsquo;
processions of London, or York, or Norwich.&nbsp; Harking back to
Fletcher, however, I may add, that in Scotland a butcher is still
a flesher.</p>
<p>So far for the butcher.&nbsp; But the old rhyme speaks
of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The butcher, the baker,<br />
The candlestick-maker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We next turn, therefore, to the bread and biscuit
department.&nbsp; We have all heard how that foolish and
imprudent</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Miss
Baxter,<br />
Refused a man before he axed her,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but few of us, possibly, are aware that &ldquo;Baker&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Baxter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bagster,&rdquo; all represent
the same occupation, and that Baxter is only the old
&ldquo;bakester,&rdquo; the feminine of Baker, just as Webster is
the feminine of Webber, or Brewster of Brewer, or Blaxter
(<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;Bleachster&rdquo;) of Bleacher, or Tapster of
Tapper. <a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Langland, in his poem entitled
&ldquo;The Vision of Piers Plowman,&rdquo; speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Baksteres and brewesteres,<br />
And bochiers manye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will not be irreverent to note the coincidence, that no
firm in England have more closely associated their name with the
printing of the Bible, &ldquo;The Bread of Life,&rdquo; than the
Bagsters.&nbsp; It reminds us of that which was no accidental
coincidence at all&mdash;namely, that Christ Himself, &ldquo;that
true Bread which came down from Heaven,&rdquo; appeared first at
Bethlehem, <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>which literally means &ldquo;house of bread,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;bread-shop,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bake-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bacchus,&rdquo; as already
noted, is a corruption of &ldquo;bake-house,&rdquo; while our
Bullingers, Ballingers, Bollengers, and Furners, and
&ldquo;Pesters,&rdquo; represent the Norman-French bakers.&nbsp;
Our &ldquo;Cokes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cooks&rdquo; represent the old
public pie-shop, as well as the private cuisine, and this
explains the large number of the fraternity immortalised in our
directories.&nbsp; An old poem speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Drovers, cokes, and poulters,<br />
Yermongers, pybakers, and waferers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has ever been a great race in this matter between our
&ldquo;Bakers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cooks&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Cookes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nearly thirty years ago Mr. Lowe, in
his Tables of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, gave the following
analysis for one year in England and Wales:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the London Directory for 1871, there appeared 277 Bakers,
56 Baxters, and 2 Bagsters, as against 194 Cooks, 89 Cookes, 1
Coke, 2 Cookmans, and 9 Cooksons.&nbsp; This preserves the same
proportion.</p>
<p>In the couplet quoted above occurs the trade name of
&ldquo;Waferer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may possibly sound an
obsoletism to the reader.&nbsp; But if as a distinct occupation
the making of bread wafers is gone, or has fallen into the hands
of Messrs. Peek, Frean &amp; Co., and other of our biscuit
manufacturers, it has left many memorials behind.&nbsp; Our
&ldquo;Wafers&rdquo; have fossilised its story <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>in the
Directory, and even in our Authorized Version of the Bible (Lev.
ii. 4).&nbsp; I have known one or two sturdy Protestants who have
objected to the translation: &ldquo;And if thou bring an oblation
of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened
cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened <i>wafers</i>
anointed with oil.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can be no doubt this is one
more relic of Papal days in England.&nbsp; I have seen an old
will of the thirteenth century, in which the then Archbishop of
York made a small bequest to two &ldquo;waferers,&rdquo; who for
many years had honestly plied their trade of selling wafers at
the Minster gate.&nbsp; Not that the &ldquo;waferer&rdquo;
confined himself to these.&nbsp; The author of Piers Plowman, not
to mention Chaucer himself, puts him among certain disreputable
street hawkers, who sold small spiced cakes; but then we must
remember that the &ldquo;Malvern Dreamer&rdquo; wrote his poem
against the lewdness of the priesthood&mdash;in fact, he was a
trumpeter of the Reformation to come&mdash;and he would not
object to set down the humblest servitor of the papal
establishment, even a waferer, in as low a scale as he
could.&nbsp; It is this that to my mind makes the history of
English surnames so interesting.&nbsp; If we visit Pompeii we see
in the streets and chambers that have been cleared of
d&eacute;bris the very accidents of life and thought well-nigh
2000 years ago.&nbsp; We have but to clear away the little
corruptions of spelling or pronunciation which have befallen
these old-fashioned names, and spell-bound we are gazing into the
life&mdash;the every-day religious and social life&mdash;of our
English forefathers four hundred years ago.&nbsp; The antiquary
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and the
philologist alike may take up the London Directory with
reverence, for therein lies a fund of information to his hand,
which it might occupy months of pain and trouble otherwise to
accumulate.</p>
<p>Having dealt with &ldquo;the butcher&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
baker,&rdquo; there is yet the &ldquo;candlestick-maker&rdquo; to
be considered.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;Chandlers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Candlers&rdquo; explain themselves.&nbsp; Our
&ldquo;Turners&rdquo; turned out all manner of wooden gear, and
doubtless candlesticks were amongst them.&nbsp; There are plenty
of &ldquo;Bowlers&rdquo; in the Directory, men who made bowls or
dishes of wood.&nbsp; The twenty-four &ldquo;Spooners&rdquo; <a
name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a> set down in the same record, fashioned
spoons.&nbsp; Forks being a modern invention, there are no
&ldquo;Forkers&rdquo;; but &ldquo;Cutler&rdquo; abounds on every
side in the metropolis, not to mention the &ldquo;Cutlers&rsquo;
Alms-houses,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Cutlers&rsquo;
Hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ironmonger&rdquo; also is well
represented.&nbsp; Those who manufactured crocks&mdash;that is,
any glazed vessel of earthenware (whence our modern term
&ldquo;crockery&rdquo;)&mdash;were called &ldquo;Crockers,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Crokers.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are over thirty Crockers in
the Directory, and six Crokers.&nbsp; A hundred
&ldquo;Potters&rdquo; figure in the same list.</p>
<p>Some reader may inquire, &ldquo;Have we any relics of <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the medical
practitioner in the Directory?&nbsp; Was there any one who was
professionally employed to see children through the measles, to
extract an obnoxious tooth, to lay a plaister, to open a vein, to
mix a potion, or to generally repair a debilitated
system?&rdquo;&nbsp; The London Directory replies unhesitatingly
in the affirmative; and yet look out Doctor, or Surgeon, or
Physician, and all are conspicuous by their absence: although, to
do the last justice, he has bequeathed us four Physicks.&nbsp;
The reason of this is simple.&nbsp; These are new terms.&nbsp;
The old practitioner went generally by the name of
&ldquo;Leech.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are forty-seven Leaches, one
Leachman, and eleven Leeches in the Directory.&nbsp; Bleeding
with leeches was evidently no unfamiliar spectacle in old days,
especially when we recall that our forefathers were wont to be
very energetic with the knife and fork&mdash;or spoon, I should
say, for they had no forks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chemist,&rdquo; too, is
a new sobriquet,&mdash;therefore he is unrepresented; but there
is one &ldquo;Pothecary,&rdquo; and Potticary is fairly common in
other parts of England.&nbsp; As for the Barber, the surgeon and
dentist of former times, no wonder there is a whole column of his
descendants.&nbsp; His custom was to hang a basin at the end of
his pole, with a string of teeth, the longer the better, to show
what a roaring trade he drove,&mdash;for he could not advertise
his business in the newspaper as people do in these remarkable
days.&nbsp; In the window were ranged cups or goblets with a few
leeches in.&nbsp; These</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Did well his threefold trade explain,<br />
Who shaved, drew teeth, and breathed a vein.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>In
the latter decades of last century there was a celebrated surgeon
in Manchester of the name of &ldquo;Killer,&rdquo; which is a
corruption of &ldquo;Kilner,&rdquo; just as Miller and Milner are
identical.&nbsp; But if this was an unfortunate name for a
surgeon, what shall we say of &ldquo;Kilmister&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Kilmaster,&rdquo; which may be found in and about the
county of Gloucester!&nbsp; How bloodthirsty they look!&mdash;and
yet the truer form Kilminster, in the London Directory, strips
them, by the addition of but one letter, of their terrors, and
shows them to be of local origin.&nbsp; In one of the earliest
metropolitan directories appears a Mr. Toothaker!&nbsp; It was
not an uncommon name, for in 1635 there embarked in the
<i>Hopewell</i> for New England, Roger Toothaker and Margaret
Toothaker!&nbsp; I do not think the name to be of German origin,
as Mr. Lower supposes, but one of those local English surnames
ending in &ldquo;acre,&rdquo; like Whittaker or Oldacre.&nbsp;
The sobriquet, however, reads oddly enough, and looks as if the
services of the barber were much required.</p>
<p>Turning to dress for a moment, we may notice that there are
nearly 300 Walkers in the London Directory, almost 100 Tuckers,
80 Fullers, and 20 Tozers.&nbsp; All were concerned once with the
combing, fulling, dyeing, and thickening of woollen goods.&nbsp;
In Piers Plowman mention is made of &ldquo;fulling under
foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; This refers to the practice of <i>treading</i>
the cloth, before machinery was introduced.&nbsp; He who did this
was a <i>walker</i>.&nbsp; Wycliffe, speaking of Christ&rsquo;s
transfiguration, describes Christ&rsquo;s dress as shining, so as
&ldquo;no fullers or walkers of cloth&rdquo; could whiten
them.&nbsp; The &ldquo;tozer&rdquo; or &ldquo;toser,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;touser,&rdquo; <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>toused or teased the fabric, so as
to raise a nap on it.&nbsp; We talk of <i>teasing</i> now in the
sense of worrying people with attentions.&nbsp; This is the
secondary meaning that has grown upon the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tozer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Toser&rdquo; are the favourite
spellings of this occupation in the Directory.&nbsp; We are still
fond of calling a pugnacious dog &ldquo;Towser.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>Tucker</i> was a Flemish introduced term for a
&ldquo;dyer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of the words connected with the
manufacture of cloth came in with the Flemish artisans.</p>
<p>I will only mention one article of dress, and conclude.&nbsp;
There is no &ldquo;Cobler,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cobbler,&rdquo; in
the Directory, but there used to be.&nbsp; As a mere patchwork
business it has got into disrepute; so it has been got rid of by
its owners.&nbsp; Christopher Shoomaker was burnt at Newbury
during the days of persecution, and Foxe tells his story in his
customary quaint fashion; but it has ever been a rare name in
England, though common enough in Germany as Schumacher, or
Schumann.&nbsp; The last form will be familiar to all
musicians.&nbsp; Camden, in a list of occupations, inserts
&ldquo;Chaucer,&rdquo; appending by way of definition, &ldquo;id
est, Hosier.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chaucer or hosier of those days
fitted to the leg from the knee downwards the strong leather
legging.&nbsp; This was called a chaussure.&nbsp; Chaucer is
obsolete in England, though not in France.&nbsp; Hosier and
Hozier still exist.&nbsp; Every Londoner knows of the
&ldquo;Cordwainers&rsquo; Hall,&rdquo; though perhaps he has
never seen it.&nbsp; It is not more than forty years ago that you
might not uncommonly see &ldquo;cordwainer&rdquo; over a shop
door instead of the strictly modern &ldquo;shoemaker&rdquo;;
while in our directories &ldquo;Cordwainer,&rdquo; <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>or
&ldquo;Cordiner,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Codner,&rdquo; is a customary
name.&nbsp; Sir Thopas is described thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His hair, his beard was like safroun,<br />
That to his girdle raught (reached) adown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His shoon of cordewane.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have only to turn cordwain into cordovan, to see that this
was a specially excellent leather, imported in early times from
Cordova, in Spain, to make &ldquo;kid-boots.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
fact, the cordwainer was the West-end boot-maker.&nbsp; But this
is not all.&nbsp; In the Directory for 1871 there appear twelve
Suters, three Sowters, six Soutters, seven Souters, one Soutar,
and three Soustars.&nbsp; I need not tell any Scotchman what this
means, because every shoemaker or cobbler on the other side of
the Tweed, except in very fashionable quarters, is still a
&ldquo;souter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Souster is but one more instance of
the feminine (?) termination.</p>
<p>I might prolong this chapter to any extent, but I must
refrain.&nbsp; I might have called attention to our many
&ldquo;Glovers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ganters,&rdquo; who sold gloves,
or our Gantletts and Gauntletts, who were in the same business,
but were known best by the gauntlet that hung as a sign over the
door.&nbsp; I might have pointed to our Girdlers and
Bracegirdles, who were busy enough when the modern suspender was
unknown; or to our many Pointers, who manufactured the points or
tags by which hose and doublet were protected from
divorcement.&nbsp; I might have asked the reader to survey with
me the rows of Cheesemans, Cheesmans, Cheesewrights,
Cheeswrights, and Firmingers, reminiscences of the good old
farmers&rsquo; produce, which was the first, second and third
course of every peasant&rsquo;s <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>dinner.&nbsp; I might have shown
that our Challeners and Challoners manufactured or sold blankets,
made at first in Chalons; or that our Helliers, or Hilliers, or
Hillyers, were thatchers or tylers; that our Shoosmiths forged
shoes for horses; that our Wrights worked chiefly in wood, our
Smiths in iron.&nbsp; I might have run through a list of rural
occupations, such as Coward for cow-herd, Calvert for calve-herd,
Shepherd for sheep-herd, or &ldquo;Herd&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Heard&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hurd&rdquo; itself for the tender
of cattle in general.&nbsp; From all temptations of this kind I
must stay myself.&nbsp; I will only say that if my reader should
be interested enough to wish to carry on such investigation, he
can do so in my book of &ldquo;English Surnames,&rdquo; which I
think I can truly say is quite exhaustive of those now forgotten
and obsolete titles of medi&aelig;val occupation.&nbsp; I have
mentioned Wright: let me quote a rhyming pun on his good old
title:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At a
tavern one night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Messrs. More, Strange, and
Wright,<br />
Met to drink, and their good thoughts exchange;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Says More, &lsquo;Of us
three,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole will agree,<br />
There&rsquo;s only one Knave, and that&rsquo;s
Strange.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
says Strange, rather sore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure
there&rsquo;s one More,<br />
A most terrible knave, and a fright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who cheated his mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister, and brother.&rsquo;<br
/>
&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; replied More, &lsquo;that is
Wright.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, Mr. More got the best of the argument.</p>
<h2><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NICKNAMES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now reached the last class
of surnames&mdash;that which we have called
<i>Nicknames</i>.&nbsp; We have dealt with <i>local</i> names,
<i>baptismal</i> names, <i>official</i> names, and
<i>occupative</i> names.&nbsp; With <i>Nicknames</i> we conclude
our list.&nbsp; John At-wood, John Thomson, John Chamberlain, and
John Baker, would respectively represent the classes already
discussed.&nbsp; John Fox might as fitly act as the
representative of our nicknames.</p>
<p>If <i>Nickname</i> be but prosthetically put for <i>an
ekename</i>&mdash;that is, an added name, a, name appended to the
Christian name to eke out or complete a man&rsquo;s
identity&mdash;then all surnames are nicknames and all nicknames
are surnames.&nbsp; It is better, therefore, that I should state
at the outset what I mean by a chapter on Nicknames.</p>
<p>I intend to take in only such sobriquets as were affixed upon
individuals by their neighbours to express <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>some
physical or mental peculiarity, complimentary or the reverse,
whether given in jest or earnest.</p>
<p>This is a very nondescript class, and is therefore much better
illustrated than explained.&nbsp; If a man developed some
grotesque or pitiful characteristic, either in his bodily shape
or his mental attributes, it was just as easy to nickname him by
the English term that most plainly described it, or to style him
by some name of the lower creation that was supposed to represent
that particular characteristic.&nbsp; Thus if Thomas were of
crafty disposition, it would be as easy to nickname him Thomas
Sly as Thomas Fox.&nbsp; Thus both Sly and Fox are
nicknames.&nbsp; There is scarcely a moral attribute that is not
found in our directories.&nbsp; In the same receptacle almost
every name of every living creature in earth, sea, and air, is to
be seen.&nbsp; Indeed, with respect to this latter class, we find
in later days a reversal of the statement met with in Genesis ii.
19.&nbsp; There it is said, &ldquo;And out of the ground the Lord
God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air;
and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and
whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name
thereof.&nbsp; And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl
of the air, and to every beast of the field.&rdquo;&nbsp; I say
this statement was reversed four or five hundred years ago by our
English forefathers.&nbsp; They gave the cattle, the fish, and
the birds, men&rsquo;s names, and gave to men the names of the
cattle, the fish, and the birds.&nbsp; There is not a single
domestic animal which was not familiarly known to <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>our
ancestors by a nickname taken from our baptismal nomenclature,
while, on the other hand, there is not a single domestic animal
whose proper name was not affixed as a nickname upon some member
of the rational community.</p>
<p>I will give an illustration or two of what I mean.&nbsp; They
shall be taken from the London Directory.&nbsp; Spenser
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The ruddock warbles soft.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of my readers will not know what a ruddock is.&nbsp; It
was the old proper name for the robin-redbreast.&nbsp; Chaucer
has the name in &ldquo;The Assembly of Fowls.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
our forefathers nicknamed this homely bird robin.&nbsp; Every
family then had a &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; in the household.&nbsp; Out
of fondness for the bird that did not desert them when the winter
snow enveloped the trees with a white mantle, but came hopping to
the doorstep for a crumb, they styled it by the familiar term of
robin.&nbsp; This nickname became so popular that it all but
pushed out the more orthodox term of <i>ruddock</i>.&nbsp; But
there are three Ruddicks and five Ruddocks in the London
Directory!&nbsp; What does this show?&nbsp; Why, that as the
man&rsquo;s name of Robin was given to the bird, so the
bird&rsquo;s name of ruddock was given to the man.&nbsp; We find
a Ralph Ruddoc registered so early as the Hundred Rolls.&nbsp; No
doubt he got the nickname from some peculiar redness of the chin
or throat, or because of some peculiarity in his habits or
demeanour, which struck his neighbours with a fancied similarity
to the bird.&nbsp; A sparrow was always called
&ldquo;Phip,&rdquo; from Philip.&nbsp; On the other <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>hand, I
find no less than twenty Sparrows in the London Directory.&nbsp;
Thus a pye became a Mag-pie, from Margaret, and we still chant in
nursery song,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See-saw,<br />
Margery Daw.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having given them Margaret, they have presented us with many
of our Daws, all our Pyes, and the one Pie of the London
Directory.&nbsp; How odd that while, as I have shown, there are
so many hundred Cooks in the metropolis, they can only turn out
one Pie!&nbsp; There is a large assortment of Cockerells,
Cockrells, and Cockrills in the Directory.&nbsp; Young cocks
still go by this name in Cumberland.&nbsp; Driving in my dogcart
to visit a sick woman on the hill-side the other day, I went by a
barn-door on which I saw a placard advertising the sale of fine
healthy &ldquo;cockerels.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I may not
linger.&nbsp; We may see in this same metropolitan record Swans,
Finches, Herons, Cootes, Ducks, Drakes, Woodcocks, Partridges,
Goslings, and Gosses, by the dozen.&nbsp; Gosling is often but a
corruption of Joscelyn, and so is not of the nickname
class.&nbsp; Goss is but the old spelling of
&ldquo;goose.&rdquo;&nbsp; In our older records we find it
registered as Peter le Goos, Amicia le Gos, or John le Gos.&nbsp;
All our Pinnicks and Pinnocks are from the old pinnock or
pinnick, the hedge-sparrow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus in the pinnick&rsquo;s nest the cuckoo
lays,<br />
Then, easy as a Frenchman, takes her flight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are eleven Wrens hopping about our London streets, and I
daresay they often stand&mdash;not on one leg, of course&mdash;to
stare at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>to think
with pride on Christopher Wren, and his epitaph, &ldquo;Si
monumentum qu&aelig;ris, circumspice.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are
fifteen Nightingales, too, but whether or no they can all sing
sweetly I cannot say.&nbsp; One of the happiest anagrams ever
written was that upon &ldquo;Florence Nightingale,&rdquo; which
by a transposition of letters makes, &ldquo;Flit on, cheering
angel.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is as good as &ldquo;Horatio
Nelson,&rdquo; which can be turned into &ldquo;Honor est a
Nilo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of these nicknames we see for ourselves could not have
been intended to be very complimentary.&nbsp; A single quotation
will prove this.&nbsp; We know that every great personage up to
the middle of the sixteenth century had his or her professional
fool, or joker.&nbsp; The &ldquo;privy expenses&rdquo; of
Elizabeth of Yorke for March, 1502, have this
entry:&mdash;&ldquo;Item: delivered to John Goose, my Lord of
Yorke&rsquo;s fole (fool), in rewarde for bringing a carppe
(carp) to the Quene, 12<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is a palpable
nickname for the office, the term itself being taken from that
bird which was popularly supposed to reign supreme over
simpletondom.&nbsp; &ldquo;You goose&rdquo; is still commonly
applied to a child that has done something silly.&nbsp; That our
&ldquo;Gosses&rdquo; should retain a forgotten and obsolete
spelling is very natural.&nbsp; There are three Patches in the
Directory.&nbsp; I crave their pardon for reminding them that
their progenitor held the honourable office of &ldquo;fool&rdquo;
to some English king or baron.&nbsp; We are all familiar with</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The king of shreds and patches.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was through this peculiarity in his dress the official <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>fool got
the sobriquet of &ldquo;Patch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s fool bore this name: &ldquo;Item: paied to the
same Pyne for 2 payr of hosen for Patche&mdash;x<i>s.</i>,&rdquo;
says an old book of &ldquo;Privy Purse Expenses&rdquo; belonging
to that king.</p>
<p>Speaking of birds, we may mention the name of Spark, or
Sparke.&nbsp; Few of my readers probably are aware that this is
but a corruption of Sparrowhawk.&nbsp; Sparhawk was the
intermediate form, and was once very common.&nbsp; It was a Mr.
Sparrowhawk to whom the great Thomas Fuller jocularly put the
question, &ldquo;What is the difference between an owl and a
<i>sparrowhawk</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; His companion at once retorted
with the reply, &ldquo;An owl is <i>fuller</i> in the head,
<i>fuller</i> in the face, and <i>Fuller</i> all
over!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was but repaying the historian in his own
coin, for no one has made so many puns and plays on names and
words as Fuller.&nbsp; He carried it to an extent which in our
day would be considered profane.&nbsp; Many will recall his
prayer in rhyme&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My soul is stain&egrave;d with a dusty
colour,&mdash;<br />
Let Thy Son be the sope, I&rsquo;ll be the Fuller.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in a spirit of devout meekness, he writes, &ldquo;As
for other stains and spots upon my soul, I hope that He (be it
spoken without the least verbal reflection) who is the
Fuller&rsquo;s sope, will scour them forth with His merit, that I
may appear clean by God&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was but
natural, that when this great religious punster died, a
suggestion should have been made that his epitaph should run
thus: &ldquo;Here <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>lies Fuller&rsquo;s earth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a>&nbsp; This was not done, and just as
well it was not; for if puns are ever objectionable, it is when
they appear in epitaphs.&nbsp; Nevertheless, one of the finest
instances of paranomasia on record is to be found on the tablet
to Foote&rsquo;s memory in Westminster Abbey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies one Foote, whose death may
thousands save;<br />
For now Death hath one Foote within the grave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar interchange of <i>nominal</i> courtesies is
observable in the names of cattle and wild beasts.&nbsp; Pigg,
Hogg, Stott, Colt, Bullock, Duncalf, Wolf, Lamb, Kidd, Bacon,
Grice, and Wildbore all speak for themselves; while in our North
English Oliphants and Olivants we recognize the old spelling of
&ldquo;elephant.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt the original bearer of the
nickname was of unusually large proportions even for the border
country of England and Scotland.&nbsp; Speaking of Lamb, we are
reminded that a brother-in-law of John Wesley bore the name of
Whitelamb, and therefore could scarcely be called, under any
circumstances, a black sheep!&nbsp; There are six Bears and
eighty Bulls in the Directory.&nbsp; The <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for 1807 records the death of &ldquo;Savage Bear,
Esquire,&rdquo; who was a resident in Kent.&nbsp; In the same
article mention is made of a Mr. Mould, cheesemonger, in Newgate
Street.&nbsp; But we have Bearmans, Bullards (that is,
Bullwards), Bulmans, and <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Bullpitts in our Directory,
too.&nbsp; It was not till 1835 bear-baiting and bull-baiting
were forbidden by Act of Parliament.&nbsp; It had reigned at the
head of English pastimes for six centuries.&nbsp; Hence it was a
common inn-sign.&nbsp; The oldest hostel in London was supposed
to be the &ldquo;Bear,&rdquo; on the Southwark side of old London
Bridge.&nbsp; Hence an old poem says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We came to the Bear, which we soon
understood<br />
Was the first house in Southwark built after the
flood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every rich man had his bearward, and the royal houses had
their &ldquo;master of the king&rsquo;s bears.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both
Mary and Elizabeth enjoyed a good baiting, whether of bulls or
bears.&nbsp; The Puritans of course were against it, and so far
were in advance of the times, but it is a peculiar feature of
their opposition that they scarcely ever refer to the cruelty of
the sport.&nbsp; Orthodox and somewhat dull Pepys describes in
1666 how he saw some good sports of the bulls tossing the
dogs&mdash;one into the very boxes.&nbsp; A leading Puritan
minister not twenty years later is always found, by his own
published diary, to have sent his children to the cock-pit on
Shrove-Tuesday to witness the &ldquo;throwing-at-the-cock,&rdquo;
and he piously prays they may be preserved from harm while away
(&ldquo;Newcome&rsquo;s Diary,&rdquo; Cheetham Society&rsquo;s
Publications).&nbsp; Thus it is we find so many
&ldquo;Cockers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cockmans&rdquo; in the
Directory.&nbsp; As for our &ldquo;Cocks&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Coxes,&rdquo; every young gallant who showed determined
pluck, or strutted in his gait, or gave himself airs, was
nicknamed from the cockpit or barn-door dictionary.&nbsp; No
wonder our Directory teems with them, for it <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>would be
looked upon in bygone days as a pretty compliment.&nbsp; This is
the origin of &ldquo;cock&rdquo; in such medi&aelig;val pet names
as Wilcock, Jeffcock, Batcock and Badcock (Bartholomew), Simcock,
Hancock and Handcock (Hans, <i>i.e.</i> Johannes), Bawcock
(Baldwin), Pidcock and Peacock (Peter), Philcock, now Philcox,
and Adcock or Atcock (Adam).&nbsp; To give my readers a list of
the views propounded as to the meaning of this desinence would
take too much space.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that nothing has
seemed too absurd for those who love &ldquo;guesses at
truth,&rdquo; without ever guessing right, to advance.&nbsp;
Every rustic lusty lad was &ldquo;Cock,&rdquo; especially if he
had a perky cocky way of his own.&nbsp; And in these names of
Philcock or Jeffcock, we simply see the old-fashioned way of
hailing Philip or Jeffery as, &ldquo;Well, Jeff-cock, lad, how
art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty well, Phil-cock,
thank&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the old play, <i>Gammer
Gurton&rsquo;s Needle</i>, Gammer&rsquo;s servant lad is called
simply &ldquo;Cock,&rdquo; without the baptismal name being
appended at all.&nbsp; It is so in the medi&aelig;val poem
entitled &ldquo;Cocke Lorell&rsquo;s Bote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we have got among the birds again.&nbsp; We must hark back
to our four-footed friends.&nbsp; There are no
&ldquo;Donkeys&rdquo; in the London Directory&mdash;probably the
only place in the world where they are not to be found.&nbsp; But
this may be accounted for, perhaps, because there are no Thistles
there either.&nbsp; Nevertheless, had there been an English
Directory in the year when Domesday Book was compiled, it would
have been otherwise; for, thistles or no thistles, &ldquo;Roger
the Ass&rdquo; is among the list of tenants under the
crown.&nbsp; Here we have been liberal: for we have <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>presented
our good thistle-loving friend with no less than three of our
baptismal names.&nbsp; In the north of England, where Cuthbert
was the favourite appellation for three centuries at least, he is
called a <i>Cuddy</i>, that being the pet form of the saintly
sobriquet. <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a>&nbsp; In more southern regions he is
known as <i>Ned</i> or <i>Neddy</i>, from Edward.&nbsp; And north
and south alike, <i>Jack</i>-ass is familiar to all.&nbsp; It is
curious to notice how a name that has become opprobrious can be
dropped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rascal&rdquo; was one of our commonest
surnames while the term only meant a lean, ragged deer; but when
it was passed on to a <i>herd</i> of worthless folk the surname
disappeared.&nbsp; One of the latest was Robert Rascal, who,
according to Foxe, was persecuted for his religion in 1517.</p>
<p>I must not omit the mention of one or two of our household
favourites.&nbsp; There are five Catts in our London Directory,
entered in old days as Adam le Kat, or Milo le Chat.&nbsp; In the
reign of Richard the Third, there was a rhyme to this
effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rat, the Cat, and Lovel the Dog,<br />
Rule all England under the Hog.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hog was the king, Rat was Ratcliffe, and Cat,
Catesby.&nbsp; It is not often we hear of cat, dog, and rat,
uniting together to worry others, and not one another!&nbsp; <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>If I recal
my history correctly, however, they did fall out in the end.</p>
<p>There must have been something sleek and smooth, if not
stealthy, about the progenitor of our friends the Catts, I
fear.&nbsp; But if our mouse-loving friends gave us their
appellation, we were bountiful in return.&nbsp; For three hundred
years the most familiar term for a cat was &ldquo;Gib,&rdquo;
from Gilbert.&nbsp; Hamlet says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For who that&rsquo;s but a queen, fair,
sober, wise,<br />
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br />
Such dear concernings hide?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in Peele&rsquo;s &ldquo;Edward the First,&rdquo; the
Novice says to the Friar:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now, master, as I am true wag,<br />
I will be neither late nor lag,<br />
But go and come with gossip&rsquo;s cheer<br />
Ere Gib, our cat, can lick her ear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Gib was short for Gilbert, our Gibbs, Gibsons, Gibbins,
and Gibbons can prove.&nbsp; But &ldquo;Gib&rdquo; for a cat is
obsolete, I fear; and now we speak of a Tom-cat.&nbsp; A female
cat was called a Tib-cat, or Tibert, from Tibb, or Tibot, pet
forms of Theobalda, which at one period as Tibota was our
commonest girl&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Gammer
Gurton&rsquo;s Needle,&rdquo; one of our very earliest dramatic
plays, Dicon (Richard) says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To brawle with you about her cocke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For well I heard Tyb say,<br />
The cocke was roasted in your house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To breakfast yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Tyb
was Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s &ldquo;mayde.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same
play the cat is &ldquo;Gib.&rdquo;&nbsp; The maid says of Gammer
while stitching with her needle,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gyb, our cat, in the milke-pan,<br />
She spied over head and ears.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kitcat Club took its name from one Christopher Cat, who
kept an eating-house in London, where the club members met.&nbsp;
The pet name of Christopher was Kit (whence our Kitts, and
Kitsons, and the island of St. Kitts, <i>i.e.</i> St.
Christopher): a conjunction of the Christian and surname formed
the term.&nbsp; I may here add that Bishop Ken represents the
Norman word for the dog, an old form being Eborard le Ken, or
Thomas le Chene.&nbsp; We still employ the term <i>Kennel</i>,
which is from the same root.</p>
<p>This interchange of civilities has not been so largely
cultivated between mankind and the finny tribe&mdash;at least,
not in England.&nbsp; Boys talk, &rsquo;tis true, of a
Jack-sharp, and fishermen of a Jack-pike or a John Dory; but
there we end our distribution of nominal courtesies.&nbsp; But
the denizens of our streams and becks and estuaries, whether in
fresh water or salt, have turned the tables on us with a
vengeance.&nbsp; No doubt, as the penalty of possessing certain
peculiarities in gait, or habit, or complexion, many of our
forefathers got nicknamed <i>Grayling</i>, <i>Tench</i>,
<i>Pike</i>, <i>Herring</i>, <i>Pilchard</i>, or
<i>Sturgeon</i>.&nbsp; <i>Whale</i> would be a nickname for a man
of huge bulk.&nbsp; Thomas <i>Spratt</i> was Bishop of Rochester
in 1688.&nbsp; We are all familiar with <i>Chubb</i>, on account
of his patent locks.&nbsp; A Mr. <i>Codde</i> married a Miss
Salt, and their first child <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>bore the name of Salt Codde. <a
name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a"
class="citation">[144a]</a>&nbsp; This is not more remarkable
than &ldquo;Preserved Fish,&rdquo; which figured for some years
in the New York Directory, and may be there now for what I know
to the contrary.&nbsp; A Mrs. <i>Salmon</i> is said to have
presented her husband with three children at one birth, and to
commemorate such an auspicious event, he had them christened by
the names of Pickled, Potted, and Fresh.&nbsp; I do not vouch for
the truth of this story! <a name="citation144b"></a><a
href="#footnote144b" class="citation">[144b]</a>&nbsp; I may
observe here that it is somewhat remarkable that quaint Isaac
Walton, the great master, rather than &ldquo;disciple of the
rod,&rdquo; wrote the life of the &ldquo;judicious
Hooker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most anglers are disposed to think that
Walton himself was the most &ldquo;judicious hook-er&rdquo; that
England has ever seen.&nbsp; At least, his success with the
fish-basket was so great, and his meditations while occupied with
his favourite pastime were so wise, that cynical Samuel Johnson
could not say of <i>his</i> fishing rod, that there was a worm at
one end and a fool at the other.</p>
<p>Talking about fish, what an odd thing it seems that <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>there
should be 181 Fishers and Fischers in the London Directory, only
eight Rivers to fish in, and only sixteen Fish to catch!&nbsp;
Nor is this all: they have only three Rodds amongst them, thirty
Lines or Lynes, thirty Hooks and Hookes, six Worms, nine Grubbs,
and not a single &ldquo;Fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor do I see what they
can want with three Basketts; surely one would be enough for but
sixteen Fish.&nbsp; Speaking, too, of Fish and Worms, we must not
forget the old epitaph on Mr. Fish:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Worm&rsquo;s bait for fish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s a sudden change,<br />
Fish&rsquo;s bait for worms,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not that passing strange?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reptile and insect world is not without traces of
representation in the London Directory.&nbsp; There is no
Alligator or Crocodile there, &rsquo;tis true; but there might
have been, had the following story occurred a few generations
earlier than it did.&nbsp; Not very long ago, in a northern town,
there was a town councillor who delighted in the use of
sesquipedalian English.&nbsp; He would never employ a short word
if he could lay hands on a long one.&nbsp; He was rather of a
positive turn, too.&nbsp; One day a fellow officer made a certain
statement before the Council.&nbsp; Up jumps our friend, and
cries out, &ldquo;That allegation is false, and&mdash;and the
allegator knows it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has been styled
&ldquo;Alligator&rdquo; ever since.&nbsp; Fly, Wasp, Bee, Gnat,
and Bugg once existed, but only Bee and Bugg remain.&nbsp;
Black-adder was formerly common, and still lingers in the
Metropolitan Directory as Blackadar.&nbsp; Bugg, however, can
claim a local origin, for there <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>can be little or no doubt that it is
but one of the endless forms of Borough, found as Brough, Bury,
Burgh, Burge, and Burke.&nbsp; Nevertheless Thomas Hood did not
seem to like it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A name&mdash;if the party had a
voice&mdash;<br />
What mortal would be a Bugg by choice,<br />
As a Hogg, a Grubb, or a Chubb rejoice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or any such nauseous blazon?<br />
Not to mention many a vulgar name,<br />
That would make a doorplate blush for shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If doorplates were not so <i>brazen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;John Frog&rdquo; occurs in the Hundred Rolls, but he
jumped out of our Directories several centuries ago: and,
possibly because his company did not please him, has never jumped
in again.&nbsp; Tadpole, &rsquo;tis true, exists: but as Tadpoles
in our Directories never manifest any further stage of
development, the Frogs have never received any increase from
them!</p>
<p>But these are not the only names we owe to the animal
creation.&nbsp; Our forefathers loved descriptive
compounds.&nbsp; After all, there is nothing very terrible in
being nicknamed a &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;stott,&rdquo;
or a &ldquo;peacock,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;buzzard,&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;salmon,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our national
nickname is &ldquo;John Bull,&rdquo; and who ever got into a
state of virtuous indignation about that?&nbsp; Yet
&ldquo;bull&rdquo; is not, taken all round, a very complimentary
sobriquet.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a stubborn, bellicose, lumbersome
kind of creature; and it&rsquo;s wonderful what a little matter,
such as a red rag, will set him into a fury!&nbsp; How frequently
we term a man a pig-headed fellow.&nbsp; That was a favourite
kind of nickname in old days, and our registers are not without
traces <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>of this.&nbsp; We have still Colfox, that is, sly
fox.&nbsp; Herring is common; but once we had Freshherring,
Goodherring, Badherring, and Rottenherring in our
Directories.&nbsp; Pigg, Grice, and Hogg are still to the fore;
but Cleanhog, Cleangrice, and Pigsflesh are all gone.&nbsp;
Hogsflesh, as stated before, still exists in the South of
England; and a rhyme says that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Worthing is a pretty place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I&rsquo;m not mistaken,<br />
If you can&rsquo;t get any butchers&rsquo; meat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Hogsflesh and Bacon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other compound nicknames of the same class are Poorfish,
Catsnose, Cocksbrain, Buckskin, Goosebeak, Bullhead, and
Calvesmaw; but they have all been shuffled out of our
Directories, to give place to sobriquets more pleasant of origin,
and more euphonious in sound.</p>
<p>In my next chapter I shall proceed with this subject, and, if
I can retain my readers&rsquo; attention, we shall discuss
Nicknames taken from moral and mental and physical
characteristics&mdash;not affixed through the agency of typical
animal names, but by the ordinary and more direct
phraseology.</p>
<h2><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NICKNAMES (</span><span
class="GutSmall"><i>continued</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">).</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> last chapter was devoted to the
consideration of nicknames of a particular class&mdash;viz.,
animal names.&nbsp; We said that, to all intents and purposes,
Sly and Fox were the same&mdash;one representing a term for
cunning, the other a type.&nbsp; But while re-asserting this
statement, we are met by a difficulty.&nbsp; Many generations
have elapsed since such a nickname as Sly was fixed upon its
original bearer.&nbsp; Did the word &ldquo;sly&rdquo; then mean
what it now means?&nbsp; Was the name &ldquo;Sly&rdquo; given as
a disparaging sobriquet, or a compliment?&nbsp; Most probably the
latter.&nbsp; Sly, or Sleigh, implied honest dexterity long
before the juggler with his sleight-of-hand tricks ruined its
verbal reputation.&nbsp; Even two hundred years ago only, when a
well-known poet spoke of a good man as one whom&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Graver age had made wise and
sly,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he was not misunderstood.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>It is
so with many other nicknames; and this explains the fact of their
existence.&nbsp; Had Sly or Sleigh or Slee been confined to its
present meaning three hundred years ago, we should not have found
it in our directories in 1878.&nbsp; Our Seeleys and Selymans,
our Sillys and Sillymans would probably have become nominally
defunct, if silly had conveyed its modern meaning to the ears of
our forefathers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silly,&rdquo; in former days,
implied <i>guilelessness</i>; we still use it in this sense in
the phrase &ldquo;silly lamb.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old proverb
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whylst grasse doth growe,<br />
Oft starves the seely steede.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best instance, however, I know of this use of the word is
in Foxe&rsquo;s Martyrology, where, describing the martyrdom of a
young child not seven years old, he says: &ldquo;The captain,
perceiving the child invincible, and himself vanquished,
committed the silly soul, the blessed babe, the child
uncherished, to the stinking prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, of
course, <i>silly</i> is the equivalent of innocent, or
inoffensive.&nbsp; Our Sillymans and Sillys and Seeleys may
fairly claim that theirs was a complimentary nickname.&nbsp; I
mention these as instances only of a large class.</p>
<p>When we come to <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> cases, we shall
discover, not with any surprise, that almost all our nicknames
are complimentary!&nbsp; Our forefathers must have been a most
highly respectable set of fellows, judging by this famous
Directory.&nbsp; They never got drunk, for who can find a man who
but rarely transgressed the limit of sobriety in our
directories?&nbsp; There is not a <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>trace of meanness or cowardice about
them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true Coward is a common name, but then, as
already shown, it is not a nickname at all, but an occupation,
being none other than our old friend the cow-herd.&nbsp; On the
other hand, see what a large number of Doughtys there are, and
Bolds, and Gallants, and Prews, all backed up by Hardy, who
worthily sits in the Cabinet.&nbsp; We meet with courtesy in our
Curtis&rsquo;s and Curteis&rsquo;s; with nobility in our
Goodharts and Trumans; with humility in our Humbles and Meeks;
with kindliness in our Gentles and Sweets; with firmness in our
Steadys and Graves; and with liveliness in our Sharps, Quicks,
and Wittys.&nbsp; Nor are more abstract charms wanting.&nbsp; It
can be truly said that there are plenty of Graces, for at least
twelve appear.&nbsp; Faith and Hope are there,&mdash;only Charity
is wanting.&nbsp; Honour, Virtue, and Wisdom, however, make up in
some degree for the absence of that gentle quality.&nbsp; Some
people are &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; but to be &ldquo;Goodenough&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Thorowgood&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thoroughgood,&rdquo; let
alone &ldquo;Toogood,&rdquo; seems only possible in our
nomenclature.&nbsp; Many people, too, are &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo;
in it, and &ldquo;Sin&rdquo; is not there, though
&ldquo;Want&rdquo; is.&nbsp; Some cynic may say that Truth is
conspicuous by its absence, but how can that be in the presence
of five &ldquo;Veritys&rdquo;?&nbsp; Not merely are we in the
atmosphere of constant Spring, and Blossoms, and Budds, but
twenty-five Summers appear in the same year, and Rosinbloom blows
the twelve months round!&nbsp; The &ldquo;Tabernacle,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Temple,&rdquo; and endless Churches for Churchfolk, Kirks
for Scotch people, and Chapells for Nonconformists, are to be
descried on every hand.&nbsp; <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Service is carried on from year to
year, to suit all tastes; there are seven Creeds; Heaven and
Paradise, with their attendant Bliss, complete the picture.&nbsp;
Oh, what a wonderful community we seem to be in this directory of
ours!&nbsp; Human nature would appear to have overridden and
crushed all its weaker infirmities, and issued forth into
something like what its poets have loved to depicture it.&nbsp;
The London Directory is the great parish register of Utopia.</p>
<p>That some sad infirmities did once really exist our olden
records show, if our directories of to-day do not.&nbsp; Who
could conceive, after this last picture, that Bustler and Meddler
once loved to make their objectionable presence felt; that
Foolhardy and Giddyhead won for themselves a vain notoriety; that
Cruel and Fierce delighted to display their unbridled passions;
that Wilful and Sullen fed their hidden and unconsumed fires; and
that Milksop and Sparewater had the impudence to show their faces
in polite society?&nbsp; Yet such was the case!&nbsp; If there
had been a directory of London published by authority under the
reign of Henry the Seventh, all these names, and a hundred others
of a similar kind, would have found habitation in its pages.</p>
<p>We may here notice that two modern instances of nicknames
occupied public attention a few months ago.&nbsp; They are of
advantage as showing how easily and even naturally sobriquets of
this class fix themselves upon the bearers, and how readily they
are accepted by the same.&nbsp; They are the more worthy of
attention because they are borne by men of high estate.&nbsp; It
was less than a year ago that the <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>English papers announced the death
of a well-known native Indian merchant who had been knighted by
Her Majesty.&nbsp; What was his surname?&nbsp; Nothing more nor
less than Readymoney!&nbsp; The worthy merchant commonly signed
himself as such.&nbsp; He was notorious for his princely
generosity, and one of his peculiarities was to pay down at once
whatever sums he devoted to the different charities he
patronised.&nbsp; So well-known was he for this practice, that he
acquired the nickname of Readymoney.&nbsp; The other instance is
that of the King of Bonny.&nbsp; He was brought up in England,
and is one of the first African potentates who has embraced and
been trained, in the religion of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; A large
amount of pepper has come to England every year from his
dominions, so the traders got into the way of styling him King
Pepper.&nbsp; The natives being more accustomed to liquid
letters, turned it into Pepple.&nbsp; What is the
consequence?&nbsp; The king has taken it for his surname; and
when he appeared two years ago at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, in
the service held by the Pan-Anglican Synod, the newspapers did
not fail to note the fact, and without any thought of
depreciation of his high position as an African potentate,
gravely announced that in the vast congregation that swelled the
limits of the metropolitan cathedral, was to be seen, joining
reverently in the service, His Majesty King Pepple!&nbsp; What
can more vividly demonstrate to us in the nineteenth century the
ease with which these nicknames&mdash;some sober, some ludicrous,
some complimentary, some the reverse&mdash;would be affixed to
certain of our forefathers four or five hundred years <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>ago, and
cling to them and to their posterity to all time?</p>
<p>Every old list of names had its large proportion of
nicknames.&nbsp; Take the members of the York Corpus Christi
Guild of the fifteenth century.&nbsp; We find such associates as
Henry Langbane (Longbone), John Ambuler (from his gait), Thomas
Chaste, William Fellowship (from his social habits), Agnes
Blakmantyll (Black-mantle, from some favoured garment she wore),
Margaret Amorous, Thomas Brownlace, William Fairbarne (pretty
child), Agnes Fatty, William Goodbarne (good child), William
Goodlad, John Godherd (if not Goddard, then Good-herd), Richard
Gayswain, Richard Preitouse, John Young, Robert Pepirkorne, John
Makblyth (Make-blithe, a very pretty name), Isabella Maw, William
Wyldest, Peter Trussebutt, John Handelesse, John Corderoy, John
Bentbow, Robert Sparrow, and William Nutbrown.&nbsp; These are
all trades members of the same guild in the then small city of
York.&nbsp; Their origins are as simple as they are
various.&nbsp; In Makeblithe, Fellowship, and Gayswain, we see a
joyous disposition; in Peppercorn and Truss-butt, the
owners&rsquo; business; in Amorous, Chaste, or Goodbairn, moral
characteristics; in Blackmantle and Brownlace, peculiarities of
habit; in Longbone, Handless, and Nutbrown, bodily
idiosyncracies.&nbsp; And so on with the rest.&nbsp; What a mine
of surnames is here opened out to view!&nbsp; How largely
representative is the London Directory, we have already seen in
the case of animal names, to which class belongs Robert Sparrow
in the above list.</p>
<p>In continuing the subject, it is at once manifest <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>that we can
but generalize.&nbsp; We have had to do so with all the other
classes; especially are we compelled in the division we have
styled &ldquo;Nicknames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look at bodily peculiarities.&nbsp; There is not a shape man
can assume, but is described in the Directory.&nbsp; There is not
an accident that can befall him but it is there recorded, just as
if it were the entry book of cases for a London hospital.&nbsp;
There is not a peculiarity in his style of dress, or management
of his limbs, or complexion of his skin, or colour of his hair,
that is not set down with as great a care as if he were a
suspected character in a detective&rsquo;s notebook.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, let us be careful not to fall into a trap.&nbsp; A
hundred local names look very like nicknames.&nbsp; Tallboy
occurs twice in our Directory.&nbsp; These gentlemen represent
the Norman Talboys frequently found in Domesday Book.&nbsp;
Longness, Thickness, and Redness, may not mean Longnose,
Thicknose, and Rednose, although nose was &ldquo;ness&rdquo; in
the days when these surnames arose.&nbsp; Thickness is known to
be local.&nbsp; Any sharp promontory on the coast is a Naze or
Ness (<i>i.e.</i> a Nose).&nbsp; Hence such a name as Dengeness
in Kent.&nbsp; A Miss Charlotte Ness inquired the meaning of the
logical terms abstract and concrete.&nbsp; The answer was given
in verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Say what is abstract, what concrete?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their difference define.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;They both in one fair person meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that, dear maid, is thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&nbsp; The riddle pray undo.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I thus your wish express:<br />
For when I lovely Charlotte view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I then view loveli-Ness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Still
we may safely assume of the great majority that they are what
they seem to be.&nbsp; We will at once proceed to inspect some of
them.</p>
<p>Let us begin with the head, keeping our eye meantime on the
pages of the Directory for evidence.</p>
<p>We have Heads (often local) and Tates many; indeed, they are
truly <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in the Directory, for
of the latter no less than eleven are in immediate
proximity.&nbsp; We have Silverlock, Whitelock, or Whitlock,
Blacklock, and the remains of an old fashion common to
medi&aelig;val beaux in Lovelock.&nbsp; Redhead, and Whitehead,
and Hoar or Hoare, and White and Brown, and Rouse, and Sangwine,
and Black, and Blund or Blunt, are an innumerable force.&nbsp;
Beard and Blackbeard are to the fore still, though Brownbeard is
gone, and probably Bluebeard never was there.&nbsp; The Directory
can show its Cheek, like any other fellow of forward disposition,
and Joule is not far off.&nbsp; And although it has no Mouth, it
possesses at least one Gumm, one Tooth, and two Tongues.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tooth,&rdquo; by the way, has been refusing some
ecclesiastic dentistry lately; but it will need a good deal of
tugging to get him out of the Directory.&nbsp; There is no
Gumboil, I am glad to say, at present, but he may make his
appearance any day, as he is known in other parts of
England.&nbsp; There are eleven Notts to be seen, and two
Notmans, whose progenitors were remarkable for their shorn
heads.&nbsp; A man was said to have a not-head who presented this
appearance, and in the old rolls was set down as Peter le Not, or
William le Not.&nbsp; So although <i>Must</i>, and <i>Cant</i>,
and <i>Shall</i>, and <i>Will</i>, look <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>as if the
Directory (they are all in it) had a strong will of its own, we
must not argue the matter so far as <i>Nott</i> is concerned.</p>
<p>Looking at man&rsquo;s extremities the feet, we again find
that it is hard to decide whether the termination
&ldquo;foot&rdquo; is of local or nickname origin.&nbsp; The
Directory has all manner of feet: a Brownfoot, a Whitefoot, a
Crowfoot, a Barefoot, a Proudfoot, a Lightfoot, and a
Harefoot.&nbsp; Lightfoot has just footed it all the way to the
episcopal palace of Durham.&nbsp; We may all, in congratulating
the learned Professor, pray that by God&rsquo;s aid he may be a
<i>light</i> unto the <i>feet</i> of his clergy, and guide them
in true and safe paths.&nbsp; Remembering too, his predecessor,
the firm, yet &ldquo;kindly Baring,&rdquo; we might concoct an
epigram of our own, and say, with many apologies to the coachman
for the liberty we take,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Come, Lightfoot, mount, the ribbons take,<br />
When roads are downward on the brake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set not thy <i>foot</i> too <i>lightly</i>,<br />
And though the reign of Baring&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold <i>bearing-rein</i> as tightly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or we might put another play on the name:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Lightfoot</i> has gone to Durham&rsquo;s
see:<br />
If name and mind in him agree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of foes he&rsquo;ll have not any;<br />
For then a lantern he will be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To <i>light</i> the <i>feet</i> of many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bishop Baring was so staunch a churchman as to put his foot on
Ritualism.&nbsp; Hence a young curate in his diocese said, with
more wit than warrant, that the <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>difference betwixt him and his
bishop was that he was under Baring, while the other was
over-bearing.&nbsp; Speaking of Lightfoot, however, I have heard
my father tell of a minister appointed many years ago somewhere
in the neighbourhood of Ashton-under-Lyne, whose name was
Light.&nbsp; Coming unexpectedly into a room where a
prayer-meeting was being held that a good pastor might be sent to
them, he heard them singing the two lines well known to most of
my readers,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sometimes a Light surprises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christian while he sings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said he was inclined to look upon it as an augury that
he had done rightly in accepting the post.&nbsp; <i>Foot</i> we
have already said is very common, but there is only one Toe, and,
as is but proper, only one Nail.&nbsp; An old epigram says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twixt Footman Sam and Doctor Toe<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A controversy fell,<br />
Which should prevail against his foe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bear away the belle;<br />
The lady chose the footman&rsquo;s heart:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, who can wonder?&nbsp; No man:<br />
The whole prevailed above the part&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Footman <i>versus</i> Toe, man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rawbones is not a pleasant name, and would be by no means
suggestive of agreeable associations to its possessor.&nbsp; Some
will recall Praise God Barebones, as he has been wrongly styled,
for his name was Barebone, and it was never otherwise called till
about a hundred years ago.&nbsp; There is all the <a

in the world between Barebone and Barebones, and a good deal of
point is lost, therefore, in the elder Disraeli&rsquo;s remark,
&ldquo;There are some names which are very injurious to the cause
in which they are engaged; for instance, the long parliament in
Cromwell&rsquo;s time, called by derision the Rump, was headed by
one Barebones, a leather-seller.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason of the
change is simple enough.&nbsp; That assembly went by the style of
Barebone&rsquo;s parliament, and thus people forgot that the
&ldquo;s&rdquo; did not belong to the name.&nbsp; The name is
found in James&rsquo; reign as Barbon, and stripped of the two
&ldquo;e&rsquo;s&rdquo; ceases to be ludicrous in any sense
whatever.</p>
<p>One of the earliest ways of forming a surname of the nickname
class was to compound with the baptismal name an adjective of
size, age, relationship, or condition.&nbsp; We are all familiar
with such a name as Little-john, which may well stand as a
typical illustration, for I see in my London Directory nine
instances occur.&nbsp; The father of the original bearer was
doubtless John, and the son being baptized by the same agnomen,
the neighbours would readily get into the way of styling him
Little John.&nbsp; The grandson would accept this as his surname,
and thus the sobriquet would become a permanency.&nbsp; These
compounds of John are not uncommon, for that was the commonest
baptismal name in those days, save William.&nbsp; Thus we have
Mickle-john, <i>i.e.</i> big John; Brown-john; Hob-john,
<i>i.e.</i> clownish John; and Young-john, an instance of which I
saw in Kidderminster not long ago.&nbsp; By means of French
importation, <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>or through our Norman forefathers, we have also
Pru-jean, Gros-jean, and Petit-jean.&nbsp; Proper-john, though
not in the London Directory, is very common in some parts of the
country, and implied that the original bearer was a well-formed,
shapely youth.&nbsp; This old use of the term is preserved in our
Authorized Version, where St. Paul is made to speak of Moses as
&ldquo;a proper child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Properjohns need not be
ashamed of their designation.&nbsp; Speaking of Youngjohn, I may
state that in one of our Yorkshire local directories may be seen
<i>John Berry</i>, and immediately below <i>Young John
Berry</i>.&nbsp; Doubtless the son was baptized &ldquo;Young
John,&rdquo; to distinguish him from his father; and thus an old
custom was but restored in a more formal manner at the
font.&nbsp; As Young John Berry has now grown to man&rsquo;s
estate, as is proved by the fact that he occupies a place of his
own in the aforementioned directory, we may, perhaps, some day
see in a future issue of that same public register,
&ldquo;<i>Still Younger John Berry</i>&rdquo; as the title of the
representative of the third generation!&nbsp; The most
interesting name in its associations, however, is that of
Bon-jean or Bon-john, <i>i.e.</i> Good John, corrupted into
Bunyan.&nbsp; So early as the year 1310 there dwelt in London a
householder of the name of Jon Bonjon.&nbsp; My readers will deem
it, I doubt not, a happy coincidence that when we speak of the
author of the immortal &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; as
&ldquo;Good John Bunyan,&rdquo; we are simply saying twice over
&ldquo;Good John&rdquo;: once in English, and once in
French.&nbsp; Probably the ancestor of the dreamer of Bedford was
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>a Norman
tradesman, who had come over to London to better himself.</p>
<p>Speaking of these Norman-French names ending in Jean, such as
Gros-Jean, Petit-Jean, or Bon-Jean, we are reminded that this
mode of forming surnames was much more common in France than in
England.&nbsp; A single glance at the Paris Directory will amply
demonstrate this.&nbsp; We find Grand-jean (Big-John),
Grand-perret and Grand-pierre (Big-Peter), Grand-collet
(Big-Nicholas), and Grand-Guillot (Big-William).&nbsp; Of an
opposite character we light upon Petit-collin (Little Nicholas),
Petit-guillaume (Little-William), Petit-perrin and Petit-pierre
(Little-Peter), and Petit-jeannin, corresponding to our English
Little-john already alluded to.&nbsp; These instances, which
might be amplified to any extent, will suffice to prove that
nicknames of this class are far more prevalent with our French
neighbours than ourselves.</p>
<p>But while such qualificatory terms as &ldquo;good,&rdquo;
&ldquo;long,&rdquo; &ldquo;young,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;proper,&rdquo; were freely applied to baptismal names,
they were not limited to such.&nbsp; Long-skinner used to exist
as a surname, also Young-smith and Good-groom.&nbsp; One of our
most aristocratic names is Beau-clerk; and its opposite,
Mau-clerk, once familiar enough to our ears, still exists in the
corrupted form of Manclerk.&nbsp; Talking, however, of ears, the
name that sounds most curious upon the modern tympanum is that of
Good-Knave.&nbsp; This is no corruption, and meant exactly what
it seems to mean&mdash;that the original bearer was a good honest
knave!&nbsp; But then, as many of my readers are aware, there was
a time when a knave was nothing more <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>than a servant or page.&nbsp;
Shakespear speaks of one who is but</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fortune&rsquo;s
knave,<br />
A minister of her will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young-husband, of which there are four representatives in our
London Directory, is a very familiar instance of this class,
although <i>husband</i> had no doubt a much wider significance in
the day that the surname arose.&nbsp; Goodfellow is also well
known; and, above all, one of our American cousins has made
Longfellow famous to all time.&nbsp; If you come to analyse the
name of the author of &ldquo;Evangeline,&rdquo; it has not a very
attractive origin.&nbsp; The earliest instances I can find are in
our Yorkshire records, and there it is set down
Long-fellay.&nbsp; Even now in Lancashire and Yorkshire a fellow
is always a &ldquo;felley.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wonder if Henry
Longfellow ever heard of Thomas Longfellow, landlord of the
Golden Lion Inn at Brecon, who must have made a somewhat
<i>long</i> face when he saw the following lines inscribed upon a
panel of his coffee-room:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tom Longfellow&rsquo;s name is most justly
his due:<br />
Long his neck, long his bill, which is <i>very</i> long, too;<br
/>
Long the time ere your horse to the stable is led;<br />
Long before he&rsquo;s rubbed down, and much longer till fed;<br
/>
Long indeed may you sit in a comfortless room<br />
Till from kitchen long dirty your dinner shall come;<br />
Long the oft-told tale that your host will relate;<br />
Long his face while complaining how long people eat;<br />
Long may Longfellow long ere he see me again:<br />
Long &rsquo;twill be ere I long for Tom Longfellow&rsquo;s
Inn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The well-known publishers, Messrs. Longman, represent, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>of course,
but another form of the same name.&nbsp; Indeed, as will be seen
at a glance, this class could be extended indefinitely; so
indefinitely that, were I to set all the instances down one by
one, I should have to write a big book instead of a small
one.&nbsp; This is exactly what the Editor does not desire; for
which reason&mdash;not to hint that the reader might be
weary&mdash;I withhold my hand: and indeed it is time.</p>

<h3>BOOKS AT MAGAZINE PRICES.</h3>
<p>The contrast between the cost of Books and Magazines is very
startling.&nbsp; For example, one Serial Tale in &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">The Fireside</span>,&rdquo; published separately as
a volume, <i>sells for</i> 5<i>s.</i>; and if the other contents
were also published separately, the selling price of the volumes
would reach to about 25<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Yet &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">The Fireside</span>&rdquo; Annual itself is sold
complete for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; In the same way, the
Serial Tales in &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Home
Words</span>,&rdquo; published separately, would make a
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> volume, and the other contents in volumes
would sell for about 10<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Yet the Annual itself may
be had for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i></p>
<p>The explanation is chiefly found in the large circulation of
Magazines as compared with Books, which entirely changes the cost
of production.&nbsp; Books seldom exceed an edition of 1000
copies, the sale extending over many months; whilst a successful
Magazine secures the immediate sale of one or two hundred
thousand copies.</p>
<p>As the first of a proposed Series of similar works, adapted
for wide circulation, it has been decided to print what may be
termed</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>A Magazine Edition of &ldquo;The
Way Home.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>The volume, which has already passed through Six Editions, was
originally issued at the price of 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; It
is now, in an illustrated, larger, and more attractive form, sold
for <i>One Shilling</i>: furnishing an example of the
<i>possible</i> cheapness of books, if they can be printed in
numbers corresponding with the circulation of our popular
Magazines.</p>
<p>Since this experiment, if successful, cannot fail largely to
promote the diffusion of Christian literature, it is hoped that
the Clergy and others will aid in introducing the volume to
general notice, calling the attention of Booksellers to it,
etc.&nbsp; The publisher will be glad to forward a <i>Specimen
Copy</i> for this purpose, free by post, to any address on
receipt of <i>twelve</i> stamps.</p>
<p>As a book suitable for Confirmation candidates, it can be
supplied to the Clergy on special terms for fifty or one hundred
copies.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>
<p><a name="footnote12"></a><a href="#citation12"

and therefore <i>local</i>.&nbsp; John de Leg is found in the
<i>Hundred Rolls</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#citation25"
class="footnote">[25]</a>&nbsp; The pedigree is shown in
graphical format in the book.&nbsp; In text it is: Starting at
<span class="smcap">Richard of Colton</span> there are three
descendents: Richard the Little, William atte Pound and Henry
Whitehead.&nbsp; From William atte Pound there are two
descendents: Bartholomew the Page and John Williamson.&nbsp; From

Henry Whitehead is descended Adam Hawkins and from him James
Bentham and Alice Adams.&mdash;DP.</p>
<p><a name="footnote26"></a><a href="#citation26"
class="footnote">[26]</a>&nbsp; Again, the pedigree is shown in
the book in graphical format.&nbsp; In text it starts at <span
class="smcap">William Belward of Malpas</span> with descendents
David le Clerke and Richard de Belward.&nbsp; From David le
Clerke are descended William de Malpas, Philip Gough and David
Golborne.&nbsp; From Richard de Belward are descended Thomas de
Cotgrave, William de Overton and Richard Little.&nbsp; From
Richard Little is descended John Richardson.&mdash;DP.</p>
<p><a name="footnote29"></a><a href="#citation29"
class="footnote">[29]</a>&nbsp; I say there are 250 Aliens in
London.&nbsp; But the Directory only gives the name of the head
of the family.&nbsp; Hence in the aggregate there may be 2,000
Aliens dwelling in the metropolis.</p>
<p><a name="footnote43"></a><a href="#citation43"
class="footnote">[43]</a>&nbsp; Dearn means secluded.&nbsp;
Chaucer speaks of &ldquo;derne love,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> hidden,
secret love.</p>
<p><a name="footnote63"></a><a href="#citation63"
class="footnote">[63]</a>&nbsp; Since this appeared in <i>The
Fireside</i>, I became vicar of a church on the borders of
Cumberland.&nbsp; I find that there is an old hall with a
celebrated &ldquo;dobby&rdquo; in it, within a few stones cast of
my vicarage!&nbsp; It (<i>i.e.</i> the ghost) is always called
the &ldquo;dobby&rdquo; here.</p>
<p><a name="footnote66"></a><a href="#citation66"
class="footnote">[66]</a>&nbsp; After the appearance of this
chapter as an article in <i>The Fireside</i>, I received several
letters from the counties of Cambridge, Stafford, and Devon,
testifying to the existence of the surname &ldquo;Robinet&rdquo;
in several secluded villages.</p>
<p><a name="footnote86"></a><a href="#citation86"
class="footnote">[86]</a>&nbsp; A servant of King Henry III. was
called by the simple and only name of &ldquo;Pentecostes&rdquo;
(Inquis., 13 Edit., No. 13).</p>
<p><a name="footnote107"></a><a href="#citation107"
class="footnote">[107]</a>&nbsp; A curious instance in point will
be found in the marginal reading of Malachi ii. 12, where
&ldquo;master, and scholar,&rdquo; in the text, is marginally
translated, &ldquo;him that waketh, and him that
answereth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, we know the corresponding duties of
master and scholar.&nbsp; The master asks his question, and then
<i>watches</i> for the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him that watcheth, and
him that replieth,&rdquo; would be understood by all
readers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him that waketh, and him that
answereth,&rdquo; will probably seem unmeaning to nineteen out of
twenty average students.</p>
<p><a name="footnote120"></a><a href="#citation120"
class="footnote">[120]</a>&nbsp; In this last record there is
also a &ldquo;Thomas le Sober.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote122"></a><a href="#citation122"
class="footnote">[122]</a>&nbsp; I must not let this statement
pass without saying that the termination &ldquo;ster&rdquo; is
not admitted to be feminine by all philologists; in fact, it is
the subject of much contention.&nbsp; It will be quite sufficient
for my purpose simply to draw attention to the existence of this
twofold desinence in &ldquo;er&rdquo; and &ldquo;ster,&rdquo;
because it occurs more frequently in the directory than the
dictionary.&nbsp; I have had the opportunity of proving this in
&ldquo;English Surnames&rdquo; (2nd edition, p. 380 and
elsewhere), so I will only add that very often where the
dictionary has dropped one form the directory has preserved it,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; For instance, there are five
Treachers and two Trickers in the London Directory.&nbsp; We do
not now speak of a tricker but a &ldquo;trickster.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Of course the meaning of a &ldquo;treacher&rdquo; or
&ldquo;tricker&rdquo; has become forgotten or confused, otherwise
our friends bearing that name would long ago have shuffled it
off.&nbsp; Webster still has the word, but he adds that it is an
obsoletism.&nbsp; We only talk of a beggar now, but &ldquo;Joan
Beggister&rdquo; occurs in an old roll.&nbsp; It is curious to
note how the weaving and dyeing of cloth have left the double
forms.&nbsp; We only speak of a dyer now, but &ldquo;Dyer&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Dyster&rdquo; figure in the London Directory.&nbsp; On
the other hand, the dictionary has both &ldquo;whiter&rdquo; and
&ldquo;whitster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;thrower&rdquo; and
&ldquo;throwster,&rdquo; the directory only &ldquo;Whiter&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Thrower.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, the directory alone
contains &ldquo;Blaxter&rdquo; (bleachster), the dictionary alone
<i>bleacher</i>.&nbsp; A <i>litter</i> of cloth (<i>i.e.</i>
dyer), or a <i>kemper</i> of wool seems never to have existed,
for only &ldquo;Lister&rdquo; is a surname&mdash;once written
&ldquo;Litster&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Kempster.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
have already mentioned Webber and Webster.&nbsp; We should think
it odd to hear people talk of a
&ldquo;<i>bellringster</i>,&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;<i>breadmongster</i>,&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;<i>washster</i>,&rdquo; but so they did some generations
ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spinner&rdquo; has never been a surname, nor
&ldquo;spinster,&rdquo; but the latter had no chance on account
of the secondary sense that so quickly attached to it.&nbsp; I
cannot end this note without once more drawing the attention of
philologists to the advantages of using the <i>directory</i> as a
complement to the <i>dictionary</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote126"></a><a href="#citation126"
class="footnote">[126]</a>&nbsp; We can readily understand why
&ldquo;Spooner&rdquo; should be so common a name, when we reflect
that not only were there no forks in use, but our forefathers
were particularly fond of sauces and thick soups.&nbsp; The spoon
was much more used than the knife at dinner.&nbsp; Our
&ldquo;Pottingers&rdquo; are relics of the old potager, or
pottinger, who made pottage&mdash;that is, soup well thickened
with vegetables.&nbsp; <i>Porridge</i> is but a corruption of
pottage.&nbsp; In all this the <i>spoon</i> played an important
part.&nbsp; I see four Pottingers in the Directory.</p>
<p><a name="footnote138"></a><a href="#citation138"
class="footnote">[138]</a>&nbsp; The same kind of wit was
exercised on Camden and his book called &ldquo;Remains,&rdquo;
and Walker, of Dictionary reputation.&nbsp; It was suggested that
the epitaph of the one should be &ldquo;Camden&rsquo;s
Remains,&rdquo; and of the other &ldquo;Walker&rsquo;s
Particles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote141"></a><a href="#citation141"
class="footnote">[141]</a>&nbsp; Another pet form of Cuthbert was
&ldquo;Crud,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Crowd,&rdquo; and hence about
Kendal and the Furness district of North Lancashire a familiar
surname is Crewdson, and Croudson.&nbsp; It is a proof of the
peculiar tenacity with which some names cling to the place of
their origin, that there is no instance of this surname in the
London Directory.</p>
<p><a name="footnote144a"></a><a href="#citation144a"
class="footnote">[144a]</a>&nbsp; The mother of Thomas Moore, the
poet, bore the name of Anastasia Codd.&nbsp; I never see this
conjunction of Christian name and surname without thinking of a
very little man with a very big hat on.</p>
<p><a name="footnote144b"></a><a href="#citation144b"
class="footnote">[144b]</a>&nbsp; A much prettier selection of
names, after a triple birth, is recorded by Mr. Lower in his
&ldquo;English Surnames,&rdquo; where the three Christian graces
of &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Charity,&rdquo; were chosen.&nbsp; This is a
<i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> instance: and I may observe here that I
have among my manuscript copies of curious registrations, met
with by myself, at least a dozen instances where either Faith, or
Hope, or Charity have been imposed upon infants at baptism.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
